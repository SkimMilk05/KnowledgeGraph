    "008.45: Clostridioides difficile infection": "Treatments are used only for symptoms of infection. People who carry the bacteria but aren't sick don't get treated.AntibioticsIf C. difficile infection is related to an antibiotic, a health care provider will likely stop its use. Often, however, an antibiotic is needed to treat another infectious condition. A switch to another antibiotic might be less likely to cause diarrhea related to C. difficile infection.Antibiotics are the main treatment for C. difficile infection. Commonly used antibiotics include:Vancomycin (Firvanq Kit).Fidaxomicin (Dificid).Vancomycin (Firvanq Kit).Fidaxomicin (Dificid).Metronidazole (Flagyl) may be used with vancomycin to treat serious C. difficile infection.SurgerySurgery to remove the diseased part of the colon may be needed if there's:Severe pain.Organ failure.Toxic megacolon.Swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the lining of the wall around the stomach area.Severe pain.Organ failure.Toxic megacolon.Swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the lining of the wall around the stomach area.Treatment for repeat infectionAbout 25% of people treated for C. difficile infection get sick again. The reason might be that the first infection never went away or that bacteria cause a new infection. The risk increases with each C. difficile infection. After three or more infections, the risk of another infection is greater than 50%.Risk of repeat infection is higher for people who:Are older than 65.Are taking other antibiotics for another condition while on antibiotics for C. difficile infection.Have a severe medical condition, such as chronic kidney failure, inflammatory bowel disease or chronic liver disease.Are older than 65.Are taking other antibiotics for another condition while on antibiotics for C. difficile infection.Have a severe medical condition, such as chronic kidney failure, inflammatory bowel disease or chronic liver disease.Treatment for C. difficile infection that comes back might include the following:Antibiotics.Treatment for repeat infections may involve one or more courses of an antibiotic. The antibiotic is often different from the one used at first. Antibiotic therapy works less well each time the infection comes back.Antibody-based therapy.A therapy known as bezlotoxumab (Zinplava) is a human antibody against C. difficile toxin B. It has been shown to cut the risk of repeat C. difficile infection in those at high risk of repeat episodes.Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT).FMTis a newer treatment for C. difficile infection that keeps coming back.FMThas been studied in clinical trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approvedFMTbut allows the use ofFMTfor C. difficile infection as a test.FMTrestores healthy intestinal bacteria by placing another person's (donor's) stool in your colon with specialized tubes inserted through your rectum. Donors are screened for medical conditions, their blood is tested for infections, and stools are carefully screened for parasites, viruses and other infectious bacteria before being used forFMT.Someone getting anFMTmight need to sign consent form about the benefits and risks of the treatment.FMTalso is called a stool transplant or an intestinal microbiota transplant.FMTrestores healthy intestinal bacteria by placing another person's, called a donor's, stool in the colon with special tubes put into the rectum. Donors are screened for medical conditions, their blood is tested for infections, and stools are carefully screened for parasites, viruses and other infectious bacteria before being used forFMT.Research has shown thatFMTdone one or more times has a success rate higher than 85% for treating C. difficile infections that keep coming back.Probiotics.Probiotics are supplements or foods that have microorganisms to keep or improve the \"good\" bacteria in the body.

Unless they are causing complications, your own kidneys are left in place.Depending on the cause, some types of kidney disease can be treated. Often, though, chronic kidney disease has no cure.Treatment usually consists of measures to help control signs and symptoms, reduce complications, and slow progression of the disease. If your kidneys become severely damaged, you might need treatment for end-stage kidney disease.Treating the causeYour doctor will work to slow or control the cause of your kidney disease. Treatment options vary depending on the cause. But kidney damage can continue to worsen even when an underlying condition, such as diabetes mellitus or high blood pressure, has been controlled.Treating complicationsKidney disease complications can be controlled to make you more comfortable. Treatments might include:High blood pressure medications.People with kidney disease can have worsening high blood pressure. Your doctor might recommend medications to lower your blood pressure \u2014 commonly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers \u2014 and to preserve kidney function.High blood pressure medications can initially decrease kidney function and change electrolyte levels, so you might need frequent blood tests to monitor your condition. Your doctor may also recommend a water pill (diuretic) and a low-salt diet.Medications to relieve swelling.People with chronic kidney disease often retain fluids. This can lead to swelling in the legs as well as high blood pressure. Medications called diuretics can help maintain the balance of fluids in your body.Medications to treat anemia.Supplements of the hormone erythropoietin (uh-rith-roe-POI-uh-tin), sometimes with added iron, help produce more red blood cells. This might relieve fatigue and weakness associated with anemia.Medications to lower cholesterol levels.Your doctor might recommend medications called statins to lower your cholesterol. People with chronic kidney disease often have high levels of bad cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease.Medications to protect your bones.Calcium and vitamin D supplements can help prevent weak bones and lower your risk of fracture. You might also take medication known as a phosphate binder to lower the amount of phosphate in your blood and protect your blood vessels from damage by calcium deposits (calcification).A lower protein diet to minimize waste products in your blood.As your body processes protein from foods, it creates waste products that your kidneys must filter from your blood. To reduce the amount of work your kidneys must do, your doctor might recommend eating less protein. A registered dietitian can suggest ways to lower your protein intake while still eating a healthy diet.High blood pressure medications.People with kidney disease can have worsening high blood pressure.

At that point, you need dialysis or a kidney transplant.Dialysis.Dialysis artificially removes waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do this. In hemodialysis, a machine filters waste and excess fluids from your blood.In peritoneal dialysis, a thin tube inserted into your abdomen fills your abdominal cavity with a dialysis solution that absorbs waste and excess fluids. After a time, the dialysis solution drains from your body, carrying the waste with it.Kidney transplant.A kidney transplant involves surgically placing a healthy kidney from a donor into your body. Transplanted kidneys can come from deceased or living donors.After a transplant, you'll need to take medications for the rest of your life to keep your body from rejecting the new organ.

You don't need to be on dialysis to have a kidney transplant.For some who choose not to have dialysis or a kidney transplant, a third option is to treat your kidney failure with conservative measures. Conservative measures likely will include symptom management, advance care planning and care to keep you comfortable (palliative care).Kidney Disease: How kidneys work, Hemodialysis, and Peritoneal dialysisKidney Disease: How kidneys work, Hemodialysis, and Peritoneal dialysis(function () {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkWidget.embed({\"targetId\":\"kaltura-video-1_tmvufeii\",\"wid\":\"_1825021\",\"uiconf_id\":44373111,\"flashvars\":{\"IframeCustomPluginCss1\":\"/-/media/kcms/ux/css/kaltura-player.css\",\"localizationCode\":\"auto\",\"playlistAPI\":{\"kpl0Id\":\"1_tmvufeii\",\"containerPosition\":\"bottom\",\"layout\":\"horizontal\",\"autoContinue\":false},\"autoPlay\":false},\"cache_st\":20200805,\"readyCallback\": function(playerId) {var kdp = document.getElementById(playerId); kdp.addJsListener('doPlay', 'doPlayCallback'); window.inlineReadyCallbackCalled = playerId; }});\n\t\t\t\t\t})();More InformationChronic kidney disease care at Mayo ClinicChronic kidney disease: Is a clinical trial right for me?Deceased-donor kidney transplantHemodialysisKidney transplantLiving-donor kidney transplantNondirected living-donor transplantPeritoneal dialysisPreemptive kidney transplantKidney disease FAQsShow more related informationMore InformationChronic kidney disease care at Mayo ClinicChronic kidney disease: Is a clinical trial right for me?Deceased-donor kidney transplantHemodialysisKidney transplantLiving-donor kidney transplantNondirected living-donor transplantPeritoneal dialysisPreemptive kidney transplantKidney disease FAQsShow more related informationChronic kidney disease care at Mayo ClinicChronic kidney disease: Is a clinical trial right for me?Deceased-donor kidney transplantHemodialysisKidney transplantLiving-donor kidney transplantNondirected living-donor transplantPeritoneal dialysisPreemptive kidney transplantKidney disease FAQsChronic kidney disease care at Mayo ClinicChronic kidney disease care at Mayo ClinicChronic kidney disease: Is a clinical trial right for me?Chronic kidney disease: Is a clinical trial right for me?Deceased-donor kidney transplantDeceased-donor kidney transplantHemodialysisHemodialysisKidney transplantKidney transplantLiving-donor kidney transplantLiving-donor kidney transplantNondirected living-donor transplantNondirected living-donor transplantPeritoneal dialysisPeritoneal dialysisPreemptive kidney transplantPreemptive kidney transplantKidney disease FAQsKidney disease FAQsShow more related informationRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

Severe injuries usually require immediate surgery.Many small or moderate-sized injuries to the spleen can heal without surgery. You're likely to stay in the hospital while your health care team observe your condition and provide nonsurgical care, such as blood transfusions, if necessary.You might have periodic follow-upCTscans to check whether your spleen has healed or to determine whether you need surgery.CTSurgery and other proceduresSurgery for a ruptured spleen can include:Repairing the spleen.Your surgeon might be able to use stitches or other techniques to repair the rupture.Removing the spleen, called a splenectomy.People can live without a spleen, but it increases the risk of serious bacterial infections such as sepsis. Your health care provider may recommend vaccinations against meningitis, pneumonia and haemophilus influenza, type b (Hib). Occasionally, you may be prescribed daily oral antibiotics to prevent infections.Removing part of the spleen.It might be possible to remove only part of your spleen, depending on the rupture.

    "293.0: Impulse-control disorder": "Although fear, humiliation or embarrassment may make it hard for you to seek treatment for kleptomania, it's important to get help. Kleptomania is difficult to overcome on your own. Without treatment, kleptomania will likely be an ongoing, long-term condition.Treatment for kleptomania typically involves medicines and psychotherapy, or both, sometimes along with self-help groups. However, there's no standard kleptomania treatment, and researchers are still trying to understand what may work best. You may have to try several types of treatment to find what works well for you.MedicinesThere's little scientific research about using psychiatric medicines to treat kleptomania. And there is no FDA-approved medicine for kleptomania. However, certain medicines may help, depending on your situation and whether you have other mental health disorders, such as depression or substance misuse.Your provider may consider prescribing:An addiction treatment medicine called naltrexone, which may reduce the urges and pleasure associated with stealingAn antidepressant \u2014 specifically a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)Other medicines or a combination of medicinesAn addiction treatment medicine called naltrexone, which may reduce the urges and pleasure associated with stealingAn antidepressant \u2014 specifically a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)Other medicines or a combination of medicinesIf medicine is prescribed, ask your health care provider or pharmacist about potential side effects or possible interactions with any other medicines.PsychotherapyA form of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy helps you identify unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with healthy ones that can be used in different situations when needed. Cognitive behavioral therapy may include these skill-building techniques to help you control kleptomania urges:Systematic desensitization and counter-conditioning,in which you practice relaxation techniques and other strategies while in triggering situations to learn how to reduce your urges in a healthy wayCovert sensitization,in which you picture yourself stealing and then facing negative consequences, such as being caughtAversion therapy,in which you practice mildly painful techniques, such as holding your breath until you become uncomfortable, when you get an urge to stealSystematic desensitization and counter-conditioning,in which you practice relaxation techniques and other strategies while in triggering situations to learn how to reduce your urges in a healthy waySystematic desensitization and counter-conditioning,Covert sensitization,in which you picture yourself stealing and then facing negative consequences, such as being caughtCovert sensitization,Aversion therapy,in which you practice mildly painful techniques, such as holding your breath until you become uncomfortable, when you get an urge to stealAversion therapy,Avoiding relapsesIt's not unusual to have relapses of kleptomania.

    "305.1: Nicotine dependence": "Like most smokers, you've probably made at least one serious attempt to stop. But it's rare to stop smoking on your first attempt \u2014 especially if you try to do it without help. You're much more likely to be able to stop smoking if you use medications and counseling, which have both been proved effective, especially in combination.MedicationsSome quit-smoking products are known as nicotine replacement therapy because they contain varying amounts of nicotine. Some of these nicotine replacement therapies require a prescription, but others don't. There are two approved quit-smoking medications that don't contain nicotine, and both are available only by prescription.Any of these products can help reduce nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms \u2014 making it more likely that you'll stop smoking for good. Using more than one may help you get better results.Although you can buy some quit-smoking products without a prescription, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor first. Together you can explore which products might be right for you, when to start taking them and possible side effects.CounselingMedications help you cope by reducing withdrawal symptoms and cravings, while behavioral treatments help you develop the skills you need to give up tobacco for good. The more time you spend with a counselor, the better your treatment results will be.During individual or group counseling, you learn techniques you can use to help you stop smoking. Many hospitals, health care plans, health care providers and employers offer treatment programs. Some medical centers provide residential treatment programs \u2014 the most intensive treatment available.Methods to avoidElectronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have not proved to be safe nor are they more effective in helping people stop smoking than nicotine replacement medications. In fact, many people who use e-cigarettes to stop smoking find themselves using both products rather than quitting.It's not a good idea to substitute another type of tobacco use for smoking. Tobacco in any form is not safe.

In this treatment, a machine delivers air pressure through a piece that fits into your nose or is placed over your nose and mouth while you sleep.Positive airway pressure reduces the number of times you stop breathing as you sleep. The therapy also reduces daytime sleepiness and improves your quality of life.The most common type is called continuous positive airway pressure, also known asCPAP(SEE-pap). With this treatment, the pressure of the air breathed is continuous, constant and somewhat greater than that of the surrounding air. The pressure of the air is just enough to keep your upper airway passages open. This air pressure prevents obstructive sleep apnea and snoring.AlthoughCPAPis the most successful and commonly used method of treating obstructive sleep apnea, some people find the mask uncomfortable or loud. However, newer machines are smaller and less noisy than older machines. And there are a variety of mask designs for individual comfort.Also, with some practice, most people learn to adjust the mask to obtain a comfortable and secure fit. You may need to try different types to find a suitable mask. Several options are available, such as nasal masks, nasal pillows or face masks.If you're having trouble tolerating pressure, some machines have special adaptive pressure functions to improve comfort. You might also benefit from using a humidifier along with yourCPAPsystem.CPAPmay be given at a continuous pressure, known as fixed. Or the pressure may be varied, known as autotitrating positive airway pressure (APAP). In fixedCPAP, the pressure stays constant. In autotitratingCPAP, the levels of pressure are adjusted if the device senses increased airway resistance.Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) is another type of positive airway pressure.BPAPdelivers a preset amount of pressure when you breathe in and a different amount of pressure when you breathe out.CPAPis more commonly used because it's been well studied for obstructive sleep apnea and has been shown to effectively treat the condition. People who have difficulty tolerating fixedCPAPmight want to tryBPAPorAPAP.Don't stop using your positive airway pressure machine if you have problems. Check with your health care team to see what adjustments you can make to improve its comfort.In addition, contact your health care team if you still snore despite treatment, if you begin snoring again, or if your weight goes up or down by 10% or more.Mouthpiece, known as an oral device.Though positive airway pressure is often an effective treatment, oral appliances are an alternative for some people with mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnea. They're also used for people with severe sleep apnea who can't useCPAP. The devices may reduce sleepiness and improve quality of life.These devices are designed to keep the throat open. Some devices keep the airway open by bringing the lower jaw forward, which can sometimes relieve snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. Other devices hold the tongue in a different position.If you decide to explore this option, you'll need to see a dentist experienced in dental sleep medicine appliances for the fitting and follow-up therapy. A number of devices are available. Close follow-up is needed to ensure successful treatment and that use of the device doesn't cause changes to your teeth.A newer device uses electrical stimulation on the tongue. The device helps improve snoring and breathing during sleep in people with very mild sleep apnea and snoring. This device isn't meant to be used in place ofCPAPwhen it's recommended for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea.It's a removable device that you place around your tongue while you're awake. It delivers electrical impulses to improve the muscle tone of the tongue. This helps prevent the tongue from collapsing and blocking the airway during sleep. The device is used for 20 minutes a day. It takes six weeks to see improvement. A dentist makes a custom device that fits you.Only a small number of studies has looked at how well these devices work. Larger studies are still needed. Don't use a tongue muscle stimulation device if you have a pacemaker or another implanted electrical device.Positive airway pressure.If you have obstructive sleep apnea, you may benefit from positive airway pressure.

In autotitratingCPAP, the levels of pressure are adjusted if the device senses increased airway resistance.CPAPCPAPCPAPBilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) is another type of positive airway pressure.BPAPdelivers a preset amount of pressure when you breathe in and a different amount of pressure when you breathe out.BPAPCPAPis more commonly used because it's been well studied for obstructive sleep apnea and has been shown to effectively treat the condition. People who have difficulty tolerating fixedCPAPmight want to tryBPAPorAPAP.CPAPCPAPBPAPAPAPDon't stop using your positive airway pressure machine if you have problems. Check with your health care team to see what adjustments you can make to improve its comfort.In addition, contact your health care team if you still snore despite treatment, if you begin snoring again, or if your weight goes up or down by 10% or more.Mouthpiece, known as an oral device.Though positive airway pressure is often an effective treatment, oral appliances are an alternative for some people with mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnea. They're also used for people with severe sleep apnea who can't useCPAP. The devices may reduce sleepiness and improve quality of life.These devices are designed to keep the throat open. Some devices keep the airway open by bringing the lower jaw forward, which can sometimes relieve snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. Other devices hold the tongue in a different position.If you decide to explore this option, you'll need to see a dentist experienced in dental sleep medicine appliances for the fitting and follow-up therapy. A number of devices are available. Close follow-up is needed to ensure successful treatment and that use of the device doesn't cause changes to your teeth.A newer device uses electrical stimulation on the tongue. The device helps improve snoring and breathing during sleep in people with very mild sleep apnea and snoring. This device isn't meant to be used in place ofCPAPwhen it's recommended for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea.It's a removable device that you place around your tongue while you're awake. It delivers electrical impulses to improve the muscle tone of the tongue. This helps prevent the tongue from collapsing and blocking the airway during sleep. The device is used for 20 minutes a day. It takes six weeks to see improvement. A dentist makes a custom device that fits you.Only a small number of studies has looked at how well these devices work. Larger studies are still needed. Don't use a tongue muscle stimulation device if you have a pacemaker or another implanted electrical device.Mouthpiece, known as an oral device.Though positive airway pressure is often an effective treatment, oral appliances are an alternative for some people with mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnea.

Surgical options may include:Surgical removal of tissue.Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is a procedure in which a surgeon removes tissue from the back of the mouth and top of the throat. The tonsils and adenoids may be removed as well.UPPPusually is performed in a hospital and requires a medicine that puts you in a sleep-like state. This medicine is called a general anesthetic.Upper airway stimulation.This new device is approved for use in people with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who can't tolerateCPAPorBPAP.A small, thin impulse generator, known as a hypoglossal nerve stimulator, is implanted under the skin in the upper chest. When you inhale, the device stimulates the nerve that controls the movement of the tongue. The tongue moves forward instead of moving backward and blocking the throat.Studies have found that upper airway stimulation greatly improves obstructive sleep apnea symptoms and quality of life.Jaw surgery, known as maxillomandibular advancement.In this procedure, the upper and lower parts of the jaw are moved forward compared with the rest of the facial bones. This enlarges the space behind the tongue and soft palate, making obstruction less likely.Surgical opening in the neck, known as a tracheostomy.You may need this form of surgery if other treatments have failed and you have life-threatening obstructive sleep apnea.During a tracheostomy, a surgeon makes an opening in the neck and inserts a metal or plastic tube for breathing. Air passes in and out of the lungs, bypassing the blocked air passage in your throat.Surgical removal of tissue.Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is a procedure in which a surgeon removes tissue from the back of the mouth and top of the throat.

    "357.2: Polyneuropathy": "There's no cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. But two types of treatments can speed recovery and reduce the severity of the illness:Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis).The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then put back into your body, which manufactures more plasma to make up for what was removed. Plasmapheresis may work by ridding plasma of certain antibodies that contribute to the immune system's attack on the peripheral nerves.Immunoglobulin therapy.Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein (intravenously). High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barre syndrome.Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis).The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells.

    "357.82: Critical illness polyneuropathy": "Your treatment depends on the type of mental illness you have, its severity and what works best for you. In many cases, a combination of treatments works best.If you have a mild mental illness with well-controlled symptoms, treatment from your primary care provider may be sufficient. However, often a team approach is appropriate to make sure all your psychiatric, medical and social needs are met. This is especially important for severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia.Your treatment teamYour treatment team may include your:Family or primary care doctorNurse practitionerPhysician assistantPsychiatrist, a medical doctor who diagnoses and treats mental illnessesPsychotherapist, such as a psychologist or a licensed counselorPharmacistSocial workerFamily membersFamily or primary care doctorNurse practitionerPhysician assistantPsychiatrist, a medical doctor who diagnoses and treats mental illnessesPsychotherapist, such as a psychologist or a licensed counselorPharmacistSocial workerFamily membersMedicationsAlthough psychiatric medications don't cure mental illness, they can often significantly improve symptoms. Psychiatric medications can also help make other treatments, such as psychotherapy, more effective. The best medications for you will depend on your particular situation and how your body responds to the medication.Some of the most commonly used classes of prescription psychiatric medications include:Antidepressants.Antidepressants are used to treat depression, anxiety and sometimes other conditions. They can help improve symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating and lack of interest in activities. Antidepressants are not addictive and do not cause dependency.Anti-anxiety medications.These drugs are used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. They may also help reduce agitation and insomnia. Long-term anti-anxiety drugs typically are antidepressants that also work for anxiety. Fast-acting anti-anxiety drugs help with short-term relief, but they also have the potential to cause dependency, so ideally they'd be used short term.Mood-stabilizing medications.Mood stabilizers are most commonly used to treat bipolar disorders, which involves alternating episodes of mania and depression. Sometimes mood stabilizers are used with antidepressants to treat depression.Antipsychotic medications.Antipsychotic drugs are typically used to treat psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medications may also be used to treat bipolar disorders or used with antidepressants to treat depression.Antidepressants.Antidepressants are used to treat depression, anxiety and sometimes other conditions.

During psychotherapy, you learn about your condition and your moods, feelings, thoughts and behavior. With the insights and knowledge you gain, you can learn coping and stress management skills.There are many types of psychotherapy, each with its own approach to improving your mental well-being. Psychotherapy often can be successfully completed in a few months, but in some cases, long-term treatment may be needed. It can take place one-on-one, in a group or with family members.When choosing a therapist, you should feel comfortable and be confident that he or she is capable of listening and hearing what you have to say. Also, it's important that your therapist understands the life journey that has helped shape who you are and how you live in the world.Brain-stimulation treatmentsBrain-stimulation treatments are sometimes used for depression and other mental health disorders. They're generally reserved for situations in which medications and psychotherapy haven't worked. They include electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation.Make sure you understand all the risks and benefits of any recommended treatment.Hospital and residential treatment programsSometimes mental illness becomes so severe that you need care in a psychiatric hospital. This is generally recommended when you can't care for yourself properly or when you're in immediate danger of harming yourself or someone else.Options include 24-hour inpatient care, partial or day hospitalization, or residential treatment, which offers a temporary supportive place to live. Another option may be intensive outpatient treatment.Substance misuse treatmentProblems with substance use commonly occur along with mental illness. Often it interferes with treatment and worsens mental illness. If you can't stop using drugs or alcohol on your own, you need treatment. Talk to your doctor about treatment options.Participating in your own careWorking together, you and your primary care provider or mental health professional can decide which treatment may be best, depending on your symptoms and their severity, your personal preferences, medication side effects, and other factors. In some cases, a mental illness may be so severe that a doctor or loved one may need to guide your care until you're well enough to participate in decision-making.More InformationMental health providers: Tips on finding oneDeep brain stimulationElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT)PsychotherapyTranscranial magnetic stimulationVagus nerve stimulationShow more related informationMore InformationMental health providers: Tips on finding oneDeep brain stimulationElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT)PsychotherapyTranscranial magnetic stimulationVagus nerve stimulationShow more related informationMental health providers: Tips on finding oneDeep brain stimulationElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT)PsychotherapyTranscranial magnetic stimulationVagus nerve stimulationMental health providers: Tips on finding oneMental health providers: Tips on finding oneDeep brain stimulationDeep brain stimulationElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT)Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)PsychotherapyPsychotherapyTranscranial magnetic stimulationTranscranial magnetic stimulationVagus nerve stimulationVagus nerve stimulationShow more related informationRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

    "401.9: Pulmonary hypertension": "There's no cure for pulmonary hypertension. But treatment is available to improve symptoms and prolong life, and to keep the disease from getting worse. You also may get treatments for any health problem that might be causing pulmonary hypertension.It often takes some time to find the most appropriate treatment for pulmonary hypertension. The treatments are often complex. You usually need a lot of health checkups.MedicationsIf you have pulmonary hypertension, you may get medicines to treat your symptoms and help you feel better. Medicines also may be used to treat or prevent complications. Treatment may include:Medicines to relax blood vessels.Also called vasodilators, these medicines help open narrowed blood vessels and improve blood flow. The medicine comes in many forms. It may be breathed in, taken by mouth or given byIV. Some types are given continuously through a small pump attached to the body.Examples of vasodilators to treat pulmonary hypertension include epoprostenol (Flolan, Veletr), treprostinil (Remodulin, Tyvaso, others), Iloprost (Ventavis) and selexipag (Uptravi).Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators.This type of medicine relaxes the pulmonary arteries and lowers pressure in the lungs. Examples include riociguat (Adempas). Do not take these medicines if you're pregnant.Medicines to widen blood vessels.Medicines called endothelin receptor antagonists reverse the effect of a substance in the walls of blood vessels that causes them to narrow. Such medicines include bosentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit) and ambrisentan (Letairis). They may improve energy level and symptoms. Do not take these medicines if you are pregnant.Medicines to increase blood flow.Medicines called phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors may be used to increase blood flow through the lungs. These medicines also are used to treat erectile dysfunction. They include sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Adcirca, Alyq, Cialis).High-dose calcium channel blockers.These medicines help relax the muscles in the walls of blood vessels. They include amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and nifedipine (Procardia). Although calcium channel blockers can be effective, only a small number of people with pulmonary hypertension improve while taking them.Blood thinners.Also called anticoagulants, these medicines help prevent blood clots. One example is warfarin (Jantoven). Blood-thinning medicines slow the clotting process. The medicines can increase the risk of bleeding. This is especially true if you're having surgery or a procedure that enters the body or creates an opening in the skin. Talk to your health care team about your risk.Digoxin (Lanoxin).This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. It can help control irregular heartbeats.Water pills, also called diuretics.These medicines help the kidneys remove excess fluid from the body. This reduces the amount of work the heart has to do. Diuretics also may be used to reduce fluid buildup in the lungs, legs and belly area.Oxygen therapy.Breathing pure oxygen is sometimes recommended as a treatment for pulmonary hypertension. This treatment may be suggested if you live at a high altitude or have sleep apnea. Some people with pulmonary hypertension need oxygen therapy all the time.Medicines to relax blood vessels.Also called vasodilators, these medicines help open narrowed blood vessels and improve blood flow.

Surgeries and procedures to treat pulmonary hypertension may include:Atrial septostomy.This treatment may be recommended if medicines don't control pulmonary hypertension symptoms. In an atrial septostomy, a doctor creates an opening between the upper left and right chambers of the heart. The opening reduces the pressure on the right side of the heart. Potential complications include irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias.Lung or heart-lung transplant.Sometimes, a lung or heart-lung transplant may be needed, especially for younger people who have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. After a transplant, medicine must be taken for life to help reduce the chance of rejection.Atrial septostomy.This treatment may be recommended if medicines don't control pulmonary hypertension symptoms.

    "412: Myocardial infarction diagnosis": "Each minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue is damaged or dies. Urgent treatment is needed to fix blood flow and restore oxygen levels. Oxygen is given immediately. Specific heart attack treatment depends on whether there's a partial or complete blockage of blood flow.Each minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue is damaged or dies.

Urgent treatment is needed to fix blood flow and restore oxygen levels. Oxygen is given immediately. Specific heart attack treatment depends on whether there's a partial or complete blockage of blood flow.MedicationsMedications to treat a heart attack might include:Aspirin.Aspirin reduces blood clotting. It helps keep blood moving through a narrowed artery. If you called 911 or your local emergency number, you may be told to chew aspirin. Emergency medical providers may give you aspirin immediately.Clot busters (thrombolytics or fibrinolytics).These drugs help break up any blood clots that are blocking blood flow to the heart. The earlier a thrombolytic drug is given after a heart attack, the less the heart is damaged and the greater the chance of survival.Other blood-thinning medicines.A medicine called heparin may be given by an intravenous (IV) injection. Heparin makes the blood less sticky and less likely to form clots.Nitroglycerin.This medication widens the blood vessels. It helps improve blood flow to the heart. Nitroglycerin is used to treat sudden chest pain (angina). It's given as a pill under the tongue, as a pill to swallow or as an injection.Morphine.This medicine is given to relieve chest pain that doesn't go away with nitroglycerin.Beta blockers.These medications slow the heartbeat and decrease blood pressure. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. They are given to most people who are having a heart attack.Blood pressure medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart.Statins.These drugs help lower unhealthy cholesterol levels. Too much bad (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) cholesterol can clog arteries.MedicationsMedications to treat a heart attack might include:Aspirin.Aspirin reduces blood clotting.

Too much bad (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) cholesterol can clog arteries.Statins.Surgical and other proceduresIf you've had a heart attack, a surgery or procedure may be done to open a blocked artery. Surgeries and procedures to treat a heart attack include:Coronary angioplasty and stenting.This procedure is done to open clogged heart arteries. It may also be called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). If you've had a heart attack, this procedure is often done during a procedure to find blockages (cardiac catheterization).During angioplasty, a heart doctor (cardiologist) guides a thin, flexible tube (catheter) to the narrowed part of the heart artery. A tiny balloon is inflated to help widen the blocked artery and improve blood flow.A small wire mesh tube (stent) may be placed in the artery during angioplasty. The stent helps keep the artery open. It lowers the risk of the artery narrowing again. Some stents are coated with a medication that helps keep the arteries open.Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).This is open-heart surgery. A surgeon takes a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body to create a new path for blood in the heart. The blood then goes around the blocked or narrowed coronary artery. It\u00a0may be done as an emergency surgery at the time of a heart attack. Sometimes it's done a few days later, after the heart has recovered a bit.Surgical and other proceduresIf you've had a heart attack, a surgery or procedure may be done to open a blocked artery.

    "415.0: Pulmonary heart disease": "There's no cure for pulmonary hypertension. But treatment is available to improve symptoms and prolong life, and to keep the disease from getting worse. You also may get treatments for any health problem that might be causing pulmonary hypertension.It often takes some time to find the most appropriate treatment for pulmonary hypertension. The treatments are often complex. You usually need a lot of health checkups.MedicationsIf you have pulmonary hypertension, you may get medicines to treat your symptoms and help you feel better. Medicines also may be used to treat or prevent complications. Treatment may include:Medicines to relax blood vessels.Also called vasodilators, these medicines help open narrowed blood vessels and improve blood flow. The medicine comes in many forms. It may be breathed in, taken by mouth or given byIV. Some types are given continuously through a small pump attached to the body.Examples of vasodilators to treat pulmonary hypertension include epoprostenol (Flolan, Veletr), treprostinil (Remodulin, Tyvaso, others), Iloprost (Ventavis) and selexipag (Uptravi).Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators.This type of medicine relaxes the pulmonary arteries and lowers pressure in the lungs. Examples include riociguat (Adempas). Do not take these medicines if you're pregnant.Medicines to widen blood vessels.Medicines called endothelin receptor antagonists reverse the effect of a substance in the walls of blood vessels that causes them to narrow. Such medicines include bosentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit) and ambrisentan (Letairis). They may improve energy level and symptoms. Do not take these medicines if you are pregnant.Medicines to increase blood flow.Medicines called phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors may be used to increase blood flow through the lungs. These medicines also are used to treat erectile dysfunction. They include sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Adcirca, Alyq, Cialis).High-dose calcium channel blockers.These medicines help relax the muscles in the walls of blood vessels. They include amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and nifedipine (Procardia). Although calcium channel blockers can be effective, only a small number of people with pulmonary hypertension improve while taking them.Blood thinners.Also called anticoagulants, these medicines help prevent blood clots. One example is warfarin (Jantoven). Blood-thinning medicines slow the clotting process. The medicines can increase the risk of bleeding. This is especially true if you're having surgery or a procedure that enters the body or creates an opening in the skin. Talk to your health care team about your risk.Digoxin (Lanoxin).This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. It can help control irregular heartbeats.Water pills, also called diuretics.These medicines help the kidneys remove excess fluid from the body. This reduces the amount of work the heart has to do. Diuretics also may be used to reduce fluid buildup in the lungs, legs and belly area.Oxygen therapy.Breathing pure oxygen is sometimes recommended as a treatment for pulmonary hypertension. This treatment may be suggested if you live at a high altitude or have sleep apnea. Some people with pulmonary hypertension need oxygen therapy all the time.Medicines to relax blood vessels.Also called vasodilators, these medicines help open narrowed blood vessels and improve blood flow.

After a transplant, medicine must be taken for life to help reduce the chance of rejection.Lung or heart-lung transplant.More InformationPulmonary hypertension care at Mayo ClinicExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)Lung transplantMore InformationPulmonary hypertension care at Mayo ClinicExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)Lung transplantPulmonary hypertension care at Mayo ClinicExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)Lung transplantPulmonary hypertension care at Mayo ClinicPulmonary hypertension care at Mayo ClinicExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)Lung transplantLung transplantRequest an appointmentRequest an appointment",
    "416.9: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease": "Many people withCOPDhave mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than smoking cessation. Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, slow progression, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life.COPDQuitting smokingThe most essential step in any treatment plan forCOPDis to quit all smoking. Stopping smoking can keepCOPDfrom getting worse and reducing your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn't easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you've tried to quit and have been unsuccessful.COPDCOPDTalk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. Also, avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible.MedicationsSeveral kinds of medications are used to treat the symptoms and complications ofCOPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.COPDBronchodilatorsBronchodilators are medications that usually come in inhalers \u2014 they relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both.Examples of short-acting bronchodilators include:Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA)Levalbuterol (Xopenex)Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA)Levalbuterol (Xopenex)Examples of long-acting bronchodilators include:Aclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)Arformoterol (Brovana)Formoterol (Perforomist)Indacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)Tiotropium (Spiriva)Salmeterol (Serevent)Umeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)Aclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)Arformoterol (Brovana)Formoterol (Perforomist)Indacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)Tiotropium (Spiriva)Salmeterol (Serevent)Umeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)Inhaled steroidsInhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations ofCOPD. Examples of inhaled steroids include:COPDFluticasone (Flovent HFA)Budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)Fluticasone (Flovent HFA)Budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)Combination inhalersSome medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Examples of these combination inhalers include:Fluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)Fluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)Formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)Fluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)Fluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)Formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)Combination inhalers that include more than one type of bronchodilator also are available. Examples of these include:Aclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)Albuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)Formoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)Glycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)Olodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)Umeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)Aclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)Albuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)Formoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)Glycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)Olodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)Umeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)Oral steroidsFor people who experience periods when theirCOPDbecomes more severe, called moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids may prevent further worsening ofCOPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection.COPDCOPDPhosphodiesterase-4 inhibitorsA medication approved for people with severeCOPDand symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss.COPDTheophyllineWhen other treatment has been ineffective or if cost is a factor, theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Theochron), a less expensive medication, may help improve breathing and prevent episodes of worseningCOPD. Side effects are dose related and may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor, so tests are used to monitor blood levels of the medication.COPDAntibioticsRespiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravateCOPDsymptoms. Antibiotics help treat episodes of worseningCOPD, but they aren't generally recommended for prevention. Some studies show that certain antibiotics, such as azithromycin (Zithromax), prevent episodes of worseningCOPD, but side effects and antibiotic resistance may limit their use.COPDCOPDCOPDLung therapiesDoctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severeCOPD:COPDOxygen therapy.If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices that deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town.Some people withCOPDuse oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the onlyCOPDtherapy proved to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options.Pulmonary rehabilitation program.These programs generally combine education, exercise training, nutrition advice and counseling. You'll work with a variety of specialists, who can tailor your rehabilitation program to meet your needs.Pulmonary rehabilitation after episodes of worseningCOPDmay reduce readmission to the hospital, increase your ability to participate in everyday activities and improve your quality of life. Talk to your doctor about referral to a program.Oxygen therapy.If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen.

A noninvasive ventilation therapy machine with a mask helps to improve breathing and decrease retention of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) that may lead to acute respiratory failure and hospitalization. More research is needed to determine the best ways to use this therapy.Managing exacerbationsEven with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don't receive prompt treatment.Exacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other triggers of inflammation. Whatever the cause, it's important to seek prompt medical help if you notice a sustained increase in coughing or a change in your mucus, or if you have a harder time breathing.When exacerbations occur, you may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, your doctor can talk with you about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking; taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications; getting your annual flu vaccine; and avoiding air pollution whenever possible.SurgerySurgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren't helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include:Lung volume reduction surgery.In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival.Endoscopic lung volume reduction \u2014 a minimally invasive procedure \u2014 has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat people withCOPD. A tiny one-way endobronchial valve is placed in the lung, allowing the most damaged lobe to shrink so that the healthier part of the lung has more space to expand and function.Lung transplant.Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it's a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and you'll need to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications.Bullectomy.Large air spaces (bullae) form in the lungs when the walls of the air sacs (alveoli) are destroyed. These bullae can become very large and cause breathing problems. In a bullectomy, doctors remove bullae from the lungs to help improve air flow.Lung volume reduction surgery.In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs.

Blood thinners may be given to help prevent blood clots.Surgery or other proceduresA diseased or damaged heart valve might eventually need to be repaired or replaced, even if you don't have symptoms.If you need surgery for another heart condition, a surgeon might do valve repair or replacement at the same time.Methods to repair or replace heart valves include open-heart surgery or minimally invasive heart surgery. Surgeons at some medical centers may do robot-assisted heart valve surgery. The type of heart valve surgery done depends on many things, including age, overall health, and the type and severity of heart valve disease.Heart valve repairIf you have heart valve disease, your health care team might suggest surgery to repair and save your heart valve. During heart valve repair, the surgeon might:Patch holes in a valve.Separate valve flaps that have connected.Repair the structure of the valve by replacing torn or ruptured cords that support it.Remove excess valve tissue so that the valve can close tightly.Reduce the outer size of the valve so the flaps can better contact each other.Patch holes in a valve.Separate valve flaps that have connected.Repair the structure of the valve by replacing torn or ruptured cords that support it.Remove excess valve tissue so that the valve can close tightly.Reduce the outer size of the valve so the flaps can better contact each other.Heart valve repair procedures include:Annuloplasty.A surgeon tightens or reinforces the outer ring around the valve. This surgery may be done with other treatments to repair a heart valve.Valvuloplasty.This surgery is used to repair the flaps of the valve. It's often done to repair mitral valve prolapse. The surgeon inserts a flexible tube with a balloon on the tip into an artery in the arm or groin area. The surgeon guides the tube to the affected heart valve. The balloon is inflated. This widens the valve opening. The balloon is deflated, and the tube and balloon are removed.

A surgeon removes the damaged heart valve and replaces it with one of the following:A mechanical valve.This type of artificial heart valve is made of strong material. It also is called a manufactured valve. If you have a mechanical valve, you need blood thinners for life to prevent blood clots.A biological valve.This type of artificial heart valve is made from cow, pig or human heart tissue.

But less invasive procedures may be available, depending on which heart valve is affected. For example, if the aortic valve is narrowed, surgeons may do transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). It uses smaller incisions than those used in open-heart surgery.More InformationHeart valve disease care at Mayo ClinicHeart valve surgeryMore InformationHeart valve disease care at Mayo ClinicHeart valve surgeryHeart valve disease care at Mayo ClinicHeart valve surgeryHeart valve disease care at Mayo ClinicHeart valve disease care at Mayo ClinicHeart valve surgeryHeart valve surgeryRequest an appointmentRequest an appointment",

    "425.4: Cardiomyopathy": "The goals of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treatment are to relieve symptoms and prevent sudden cardiac death in people at high risk. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms. You and your health care provider will discuss the most appropriate treatment for your condition.If you have cardiomyopathy and are pregnant or thinking about pregnancy, your health care provider might recommend that you see a doctor experienced in caring for women with high-risk pregnancies (perinatologist or maternal-fetal medicine specialist).MedicationsMedications can help reduce how strongly the heart muscle squeezes and slow the heart rate so that the heart can pump blood better. Medications to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and its symptoms might include:Beta blockers such as metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL), propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL) or atenolol (Tenormin)Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil (Verelan, Calan SR,) or diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac)Heart rhythm drugs such as amiodarone (Pacerone) or disopyramide (Norpace)Blood thinners such as warfarin (Jantoven), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto) or apixaban (Eliquis) to prevent blood clots if you have atrial fibrillation or the apical type of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which can increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.Beta blockers such as metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL), propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL) or atenolol (Tenormin)Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil (Verelan, Calan SR,) or diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac)Heart rhythm drugs such as amiodarone (Pacerone) or disopyramide (Norpace)Blood thinners such as warfarin (Jantoven), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto) or apixaban (Eliquis) to prevent blood clots if you have atrial fibrillation or the apical type of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which can increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.Surgeries or other proceduresSeptal myectomyEnlarge imageCloseSeptal myectomySeptal myectomyA septal myectomy is an open-heart procedure in which the surgeon removes part of the thickened, overgrown septum between the ventricles, as shown in the heart on the right.Septal myectomyEnlarge imageSeptal myectomyEnlarge imageEnlarge imageCloseSeptal myectomySeptal myectomyA septal myectomy is an open-heart procedure in which the surgeon removes part of the thickened, overgrown septum between the ventricles, as shown in the heart on the right.CloseSeptal myectomySeptal myectomyA septal myectomy is an open-heart procedure in which the surgeon removes part of the thickened, overgrown septum between the ventricles, as shown in the heart on the right.CloseSeptal myectomySeptal myectomyA septal myectomy is an open-heart procedure in which the surgeon removes part of the thickened, overgrown septum between the ventricles, as shown in the heart on the right.CloseCloseCloseSeptal myectomySeptal myectomyA septal myectomy is an open-heart procedure in which the surgeon removes part of the thickened, overgrown septum between the ventricles, as shown in the heart on the right.Septal myectomyA septal myectomy is an open-heart procedure in which the surgeon removes part of the thickened, overgrown septum between the ventricles, as shown in the heart on the right.Apical myectomyEnlarge imageCloseApical myectomyApical myectomyA septal myectomy is an open-heart procedure in which the surgeon removes part of the thickened, overgrown septum between the ventricles.

They include:Septal myectomy.This open-heart surgery might be recommended if medications don't improve symptoms. It involves removing part of the thickened, overgrown wall (septum) between the heart chambers. Septal myectomy helps improve blood flow out of the heart and reduces backward flow of blood through the mitral valve (mitral regurgitation).The surgery can be done using different approaches, depending on the location of the thickened heart muscle. In one type, called apical myectomy, surgeons remove thickened heart muscle from near the tip of the heart. Sometimes the mitral valve is repaired at the same time.Septal ablation.This procedure destroys the thickened heart muscle with alcohol. The alcohol is injected through a long, thin tube (catheter) into the artery supplying blood to that area. Possible complications include disruption of the heart's electrical system (heart block), which requires implantation of a pacemaker.Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).AnICDis a small device that continuously monitors the heartbeat.

Ommen, M.D., Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic:The hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition that has been under-diagnosed and overly feared throughout the world. In the United States alone, there are over a half a million people that have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, many of whom are completely asymptomatic and unaware of their diagnosis. Some people can die suddenly. Sudden cardiac death occurs randomly without warning.Hartzell V. Schaff, M.D., Cardiac Surgery, Mayo Clinic:Over 2/3 of the patients will have obstruction. And the obstruction to the left ventricular outflow tract is an indication for operation in patients that have symptoms. So we know now that 2/3 of the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and obstruction are candidates for surgery.Dr. Ommen:Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common inherited cardiomyopathy or heart muscle disease. People are born with the genetics for it, but the hypertrophy doesn't appear to start developing until adolescence, growth spurts, or beyond. It is possible for infants to born with thick heart muscles, but that's really quite rare and usually more severe expressions of the disease. And it's also been described as not coming on until people were in their fifth or sixth decade of life. So really, the onset can be at any time of life. And certainly the symptoms can occur throughout life.Dr. Schaff:The common symptoms that patients have when they have obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are shortness of breath, angina-like chest pain and syncope. And unfortunately, some of these symptoms develop so slowly and over such a long time that the patients don't really understand how limited they are.Dr. Ommen:For patients who have symptoms due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the first line of therapy is always to use medical management, medications. Usually, that's adding specific medications, but sometimes patients are on medications that can make their situation worse. And so some of the most effective therapy is removing the wrong agents, and then perhaps having to add in the right agents to help them with their symptoms down stream.For patients who don't respond to those medical changes, or for whom those medications caused side effects that are intolerable, then that's when we move to things like surgical myectomy, which can more definitively relieve their symptoms.Dr. Schaff:The patients who are referred for surgery almost always have either failed medical treatment or have side effects from the medicines that limit them just as much as the symptoms from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. So operation to relieve outflow tract obstruction is to relieve the symptoms. And in some patients, to allow them to get off of the medications that are having unwanted side effects.Dr. Ommen:Surgical myectomy has been a very successful operation for many of our patients. However, it is not utilized as much as it maybe could be in part owing to prior perceptions about increased risk with the operation, lack of universal availability of surgeons who can do it. But in the hands of expert centers, the complication rates are very low and our success rates are very high.Dr. Schaff:We now do a more extensive septal myectomy that extends towards the apex of the heart. And we've learned over the years that it's this distal portion of myectomy that's the most important in terms of relieving symptoms. The few patients who have had a second operation, who have been referred to us after having an operation that was unsuccessful, we found that the myectomy was not carried far enough into the ventricle. It's really not a regrowth of muscle. It's just an inadequate initial operation.Dr. Ommen:With surgical myectomy, the surgeon removes a portion of the hypertrophied septum, which is narrowing the path of blood, out of the heart. By doing this, it changes the direction the blood flows through the ventricle. It allows the mitral valve to function normally. And allows blood to leave the heart without increasing pressures or increasing forces. This muscle doesn't regrow over time. It is a permanent fix.Dr. Schaff:We found that it's rarely necessary to do something to the mitral valve. And the hazard with doing something to the mitral valve, where it turns out to be unnecessary, is there is a chance of injury. So we would prefer to do a septal myectomy, come off bypass, assess the mitral valve with an echocardiogram during surgery, before then addressing the mitral valve if there is residual regurgitation.We can tell if the mitral regurgitation is relieved immediately after the myectomy once the aorta is closed and the heart is restarted. The echocardiogram is done in the operating room and we know right away whether the mitral regurgitation has been relieved. An operation is available for some patients that have non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. And these are patients with the apical distribution of hypertrophy.Some of those patients have diastolic heart failure related to very small ventricular cavities. And in these patients, doing a transapical myectomy to enlarge the ventricle can improve their symptoms of heart failure.Dr. Ommen:While we see great results from the surgical myectomy as performed now, it is still something that should only be performed at true centers of excellence. Recent data that have come out have suggested that at low, medium, and even quote unquote \"high volume\" centers, there is a gradient of mortality, meaning it's highest at the low volume centers and lowest at the high volume centers.But even those so-called high volume centers have mortality rates that are dramatically higher than what is reported from the true expert centers. And this is a procedure that should be done by those who are very familiar with this procedure, and doing a lot of them.Dr. Schaff:At Mayo Clinic, we've done over 3,000 operations for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We do 200 to 250 operations each year. The mortality for the procedure is less than 1%, especially for patients who are otherwise healthy.Dr. Ommen:One of the biggest parts of every interaction that I have with patients is helping them understand what their individual risk for sudden cardiac death might be, and whether they might consider having an implantable defibrillator. Our patients who have had surgery have a lower rate of sudden cardiac death and a lower rate for their defibrillators to discharge among those who have had them.Dr. Schaff:One of the things we've learned after doing septal myectomy is that actually the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia seems to be reduced. And this is shown in studies that look at defibrillator discharges and rates of sudden death.Dr. Ommen:The inheritance pattern of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is autosomal dominant, which means each of the children of a patient withHCMhas a 50/50 chance of inheriting this disease. We do recommend screening for all first-degree relatives, which is either genetic testing or echocardiographic-based surveillance. When a family has chosen to use echocardiography as their screening tool, we recommend that adult first-degree relatives get screened every five years. First-degree relatives who are adolescents or athletes, we usually screen every 12 to 18 months.Dr. Schaff:Septal myectomy cures the symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy when it relieves the obstruction. But of course, patients still have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, still need to be followed by their physician for the other problems related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. But hopefully, are relieved of the shortness of breath, chest pain, or light-headedness that leads to the operation.Show transcriptfor video Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and treatment optionsShow transcriptfor video Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and treatment optionsSteve R.

So operation to relieve outflow tract obstruction is to relieve the symptoms. And in some patients, to allow them to get off of the medications that are having unwanted side effects.Dr. Ommen:Surgical myectomy has been a very successful operation for many of our patients. However, it is not utilized as much as it maybe could be in part owing to prior perceptions about increased risk with the operation, lack of universal availability of surgeons who can do it. But in the hands of expert centers, the complication rates are very low and our success rates are very high.Dr. Schaff:We now do a more extensive septal myectomy that extends towards the apex of the heart. And we've learned over the years that it's this distal portion of myectomy that's the most important in terms of relieving symptoms. The few patients who have had a second operation, who have been referred to us after having an operation that was unsuccessful, we found that the myectomy was not carried far enough into the ventricle. It's really not a regrowth of muscle. It's just an inadequate initial operation.Dr. Ommen:With surgical myectomy, the surgeon removes a portion of the hypertrophied septum, which is narrowing the path of blood, out of the heart. By doing this, it changes the direction the blood flows through the ventricle. It allows the mitral valve to function normally. And allows blood to leave the heart without increasing pressures or increasing forces. This muscle doesn't regrow over time. It is a permanent fix.Dr. Schaff:We found that it's rarely necessary to do something to the mitral valve. And the hazard with doing something to the mitral valve, where it turns out to be unnecessary, is there is a chance of injury. So we would prefer to do a septal myectomy, come off bypass, assess the mitral valve with an echocardiogram during surgery, before then addressing the mitral valve if there is residual regurgitation.We can tell if the mitral regurgitation is relieved immediately after the myectomy once the aorta is closed and the heart is restarted. The echocardiogram is done in the operating room and we know right away whether the mitral regurgitation has been relieved. An operation is available for some patients that have non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. And these are patients with the apical distribution of hypertrophy.Some of those patients have diastolic heart failure related to very small ventricular cavities. And in these patients, doing a transapical myectomy to enlarge the ventricle can improve their symptoms of heart failure.Dr. Ommen:While we see great results from the surgical myectomy as performed now, it is still something that should only be performed at true centers of excellence. Recent data that have come out have suggested that at low, medium, and even quote unquote \"high volume\" centers, there is a gradient of mortality, meaning it's highest at the low volume centers and lowest at the high volume centers.But even those so-called high volume centers have mortality rates that are dramatically higher than what is reported from the true expert centers. And this is a procedure that should be done by those who are very familiar with this procedure, and doing a lot of them.Dr. Schaff:At Mayo Clinic, we've done over 3,000 operations for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We do 200 to 250 operations each year. The mortality for the procedure is less than 1%, especially for patients who are otherwise healthy.Dr. Ommen:One of the biggest parts of every interaction that I have with patients is helping them understand what their individual risk for sudden cardiac death might be, and whether they might consider having an implantable defibrillator. Our patients who have had surgery have a lower rate of sudden cardiac death and a lower rate for their defibrillators to discharge among those who have had them.Dr. Schaff:One of the things we've learned after doing septal myectomy is that actually the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia seems to be reduced. And this is shown in studies that look at defibrillator discharges and rates of sudden death.Dr. Ommen:The inheritance pattern of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is autosomal dominant, which means each of the children of a patient withHCMhas a 50/50 chance of inheriting this disease. We do recommend screening for all first-degree relatives, which is either genetic testing or echocardiographic-based surveillance. When a family has chosen to use echocardiography as their screening tool, we recommend that adult first-degree relatives get screened every five years. First-degree relatives who are adolescents or athletes, we usually screen every 12 to 18 months.Dr. Schaff:Septal myectomy cures the symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy when it relieves the obstruction. But of course, patients still have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, still need to be followed by their physician for the other problems related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. But hopefully, are relieved of the shortness of breath, chest pain, or light-headedness that leads to the operation.Steve R. Ommen, M.D., Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic:The hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition that has been under-diagnosed and overly feared throughout the world. In the United States alone, there are over a half a million people that have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, many of whom are completely asymptomatic and unaware of their diagnosis. Some people can die suddenly. Sudden cardiac death occurs randomly without warning.Steve R. Ommen, M.D., Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic:Hartzell V. Schaff, M.D., Cardiac Surgery, Mayo Clinic:Over 2/3 of the patients will have obstruction. And the obstruction to the left ventricular outflow tract is an indication for operation in patients that have symptoms. So we know now that 2/3 of the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and obstruction are candidates for surgery.Hartzell V. Schaff, M.D., Cardiac Surgery, Mayo Clinic:Dr. Ommen:Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common inherited cardiomyopathy or heart muscle disease. People are born with the genetics for it, but the hypertrophy doesn't appear to start developing until adolescence, growth spurts, or beyond. It is possible for infants to born with thick heart muscles, but that's really quite rare and usually more severe expressions of the disease. And it's also been described as not coming on until people were in their fifth or sixth decade of life. So really, the onset can be at any time of life. And certainly the symptoms can occur throughout life.Dr. Ommen:Dr. Schaff:The common symptoms that patients have when they have obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are shortness of breath, angina-like chest pain and syncope. And unfortunately, some of these symptoms develop so slowly and over such a long time that the patients don't really understand how limited they are.Dr. Schaff:Dr. Ommen:For patients who have symptoms due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the first line of therapy is always to use medical management, medications. Usually, that's adding specific medications, but sometimes patients are on medications that can make their situation worse. And so some of the most effective therapy is removing the wrong agents, and then perhaps having to add in the right agents to help them with their symptoms down stream.Dr. Ommen:For patients who don't respond to those medical changes, or for whom those medications caused side effects that are intolerable, then that's when we move to things like surgical myectomy, which can more definitively relieve their symptoms.Dr. Schaff:The patients who are referred for surgery almost always have either failed medical treatment or have side effects from the medicines that limit them just as much as the symptoms from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

    "427.1: Ventricular tachycardia": "Ventricular tachycardia treatment at Mayo ClinicA Mayo Clinic health care provider delivers specialized care for ventricular tachycardia.Ventricular tachycardia treatment at Mayo ClinicA Mayo Clinic health care provider delivers specialized care for ventricular tachycardia.Ventricular fibrillation that lasts longer than 30 seconds (sustainedVT) often requires urgent medical treatment, as this condition may sometimes lead to sudden cardiac death.VTThe goals of ventricular tachycardia treatment are to slow a rapid heartbeat when it occurs and to prevent future episodes of a fast heart rate. Treatment may include medications or procedures to control or reset the heart rhythm.If another medical condition is causing tachycardia, treating the underlying problem may reduce or prevent episodes of a fast heartbeat.MedicationsIf you have ventricular tachycardia, you may be given medications called anti-arrhythmics by mouth orIVto slow the fast heart rate. Other heart medications, such as calcium channel blockers and beta blockers, may be prescribed with anti-arrhythmic drugs.IVCardioversionThis medical procedure is generally used when emergency care is needed for a rapid heart rate, such as that seen with sustained ventricular tachycardia. Cardioversion sends electric shocks to the heart through sensors (electrodes) placed on the chest. The shock affects the heart's electrical signals and restores a regular heartbeat. It's also possible to do cardioversion with medications.A shock can also be delivered to the heart using an automated external defibrillator (AED).Surgery or other proceduresImplantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)Enlarge imageCloseImplantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) controls the heart rhythm.

Sensors (electrodes) on the tip of the catheter use heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in the heart to block irregular electrical signals and restore the heart rhythm. Catheter ablation is often done when an extra signaling pathway is responsible for the fast heart rate.Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).Your health care provider may recommend this device if you're at high risk of developing ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. AnICDis a pager-sized device implanted under the skin near the collarbone. It continuously monitors the heartbeat and delivers precisely calibrated electrical shocks when an irregular rhythm (arrhythmia) is detected. The shocks help restore a regular heart rhythm.Pacemaker.This small device is surgically implanted under the skin in the chest area. When the pacemaker detects an irregular heartbeat, it sends an electrical pulse that helps correct the heart's rhythm.Maze procedure.In this procedure, a surgeon makes tiny incisions in the upper half of the heart (atria) to create a pattern (or maze) of scar tissue. The heart's signals can't pass through scar tissue. So the maze can block stray electrical heart signals that cause some types of tachycardia.Open-heart surgery.Sometimes open-heart surgery may be needed to destroy an extra electrical pathway causing tachycardia. Surgery is usually done only when other treatment options don't work or when surgery is needed to treat another heart disorder.Catheter ablation.In this procedure, a health care provider threads one or more thin, flexible tubes (catheters) through an artery, usually in the groin, and guides them to the heart.

Most people need additional or alternative medicines, such as calcium channel blockers or beta blockers.Medicines to control the heart rate and rhythm.Also called anti-arrhythmics, this type of medicine is used sparingly. They tend to have more side effects than other medicines to control the heart rate.Blood thinners.Also called anticoagulants, these medicines help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of stroke. Blood thinners include warfarin (Jantoven), apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), edoxaban (Savaysa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto). If you take warfarin, you'll need to have regular blood tests to monitor the medicine's effects.Beta blockers.These medicines help slow the heart rate.Beta blockers.Calcium channel blockers.These medicines control the heart rate but may need to be avoided by those who have heart failure or low blood pressure.Calcium channel blockers.Digoxin.This medicine may control the heart rate at rest, but not as well during activity.

However, it may be done in emergency situations. If it's scheduled, a blood thinner such as warfarin (Jantoven) may need to be taken for a few weeks before the procedure. The medicine reduces the risk of blood clots and strokes.After electrical cardioversion, medicines to control the heart rhythm may be needed for life to prevent future episodes of atrial fibrillation. Even with medicine,AFibcould return.AFibSurgery or catheter proceduresAV node ablationEnlarge imageCloseAV node ablationAV node ablationAtrioventricular (AV) node ablation is a treatment for irregular heartbeats.

Once theAVnode is destroyed, a device called a pacemaker is needed for life to maintain the heart rhythm.AVIfAFibdoesn't get better with medicine or other treatments, a procedure called cardiac ablation may be necessary. Sometimes ablation is the first treatment.AFibCardiac ablation uses heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in the heart. The scars disrupt irregular heart signals and restore a typical heartbeat. A doctor inserts a flexible tube called a catheter through a blood vessel, usually in your groin, and into your heart. More than one catheter may be used. Sensors on the tip of the catheter apply the cold or heat energy.Less commonly, ablation is done using a scalpel during open-heart surgery.There are several types of cardiac ablation. The type used to treat atrial fibrillation depends on your specific symptoms, overall health and whether you're having another heart surgery.Atrioventricular (AV) node ablation.Heat energy is usually applied to the heart tissue at theAVnode to destroy the electrical signaling connection. After this treatment, a pacemaker is needed for life.Maze procedure.A doctor uses heat or cold energy or a scalpel to create a pattern \u2014 or maze \u2013 of scar tissue in the upper chambers of the heart. Scar tissue doesn't send electrical signals. So the maze interferes with the stray heart signals that cause atrial fibrillation.If a scalpel is used to create the maze pattern, open-heart surgery is necessary. This is called the surgical maze procedure. It's the preferredAFibtreatment in those who need another heart surgery, such as coronary artery bypass surgery or heart valve repair.Hybrid atrial fibrillation ablation.This therapy combines ablation with surgery. It is used to treat long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation.Atrioventricular (AV) node ablation.Heat energy is usually applied to the heart tissue at theAVnode to destroy the electrical signaling connection.

It is used to treat long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation.Hybrid atrial fibrillation ablation.Atrial fibrillation may return after cardiac ablation. If this happens, another ablation or heart treatment may be recommended. After cardiac ablation, lifelong blood thinners may be needed to prevent strokes.If you haveAFibbut can't take blood thinners, you may need a procedure to seal a small sac in the left upper heart chamber. This sac, called an appendage, is where mostAFibrelated clots form. This procedure is called left atrial appendage closure. A closure device is gently guided through a catheter to the sac. Once the device is in place, the catheter is removed. The device stays in permanently. Surgery to close the left atrial appendage also is an option for some people withAFibwho are having another heart surgery.AFibAFibAFibMore InformationAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAtrial fibrillation ablationAV node ablationCardiac ablationMaze procedureMinimally invasive heart surgeryPulmonary vein isolationMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillationShow more related informationMore InformationAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAtrial fibrillation ablationAV node ablationCardiac ablationMaze procedureMinimally invasive heart surgeryPulmonary vein isolationMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillationShow more related informationAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAtrial fibrillation ablationAV node ablationCardiac ablationMaze procedureMinimally invasive heart surgeryPulmonary vein isolationMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillationAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo ClinicAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAblation therapyAtrial fibrillation ablationAtrial fibrillation ablationAV node ablationAV node ablationCardiac ablationCardiac ablationMaze procedureMaze procedureMinimally invasive heart surgeryMinimally invasive heart surgeryPulmonary vein isolationPulmonary vein isolationMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillationMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillationShow more related informationRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

    "428.23: Heart failure": "Treatment of heart failure may depend on the cause. Treatment often includes lifestyle changes and medicines. If another health condition is causing the heart to fail, treating it may reverse heart failure.Some people with heart failure need surgery to open blocked arteries or to place a device to help the heart work better.With treatment, symptoms of heart failure may improve.MedicationsA combination of medicines may be used to treat heart failure. The specific medicines used depend on the cause of heart failure and the symptoms. Medicines to treat heart failure include:Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.These drugs relax blood vessels to lower blood pressure, improve blood flow and decrease the strain on the heart. Examples include enalapril (Vasotec, Epaned), lisinopril (Zestril, Qbrelis) and captopril.Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).These drugs have many of the same benefits asACEinhibitors. They may be an option for people who can't tolerateACEinhibitors. They include losartan (Cozaar), valsartan (Diovan) and candesartan (Atacand).Angiotensin receptor plus neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs).This medicine uses two blood pressure drugs to treat heart failure. The combination medicine is sacubitril-valsartan (Entresto). It's used to treat some people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. It may help prevent the need for a hospital stay in those people.Beta blockers.These medicines slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure. They reduce the symptoms of heart failure and help the heart work better. If you have heart failure, beta blockers may help you live longer. Examples include carvedilol (Coreg), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL, Kapspargo Sprinkle) and bisoprolol.Diuretics.Often called water pills, these medicines make you urinate more frequently. This helps prevent fluid buildup in your body. Diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix, Furoscix), also decrease fluid in the lungs, so it's easier to breathe.Some diuretics make the body lose potassium and magnesium. Your health care provider may recommend supplements to treat this. If you're taking a diuretic, you may have regular blood tests to check your potassium and magnesium levels.Potassium-sparing diuretics.Also called aldosterone antagonists, these drugs include spironolactone (Aldactone, Carospir) and eplerenone (Inspra). They may help people with severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) live longer.Unlike some other diuretics, these medicines can raise the level of potassium in the blood to dangerous levels. Talk to your health care provider about your diet and potassium intake.Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.These medicines help lower blood sugar. They are often prescribed with diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. But they're also one of the first treatments for heart failure. That's because several studies showed that the medicine lowered the risk of hospital stays and death in people with certain types of heart failure \u2014 even if they didn't have diabetes. These medicines include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance).Digoxin (Lanoxin).This drug, also called digitalis, helps the heart squeeze better to pump blood. It also tends to slow the heartbeat. Digoxin reduces heart failure symptoms in people withHFrEF. It may be more likely to be given to someone with a heart rhythm problem, such as atrial fibrillation.Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (BiDil).This drug combination helps relax blood vessels. It may be added to your treatment plan if you have severe heart failure symptoms andACEinhibitors or beta blockers haven't helped.Vericiguat (Verquvo).This medicine for chronic heart failure is taken once a day by mouth. It's a type of drug called an oral soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator. In studies, people with high-risk heart failure who took this medicine had fewer hospital stays for heart failure and heart disease-related deaths compared with those who got a dummy pill.Positive inotropes.These medicines may be given by IV to people with certain types of severe heart failure who are in the hospital. Positive inotropes can help the heart pump blood better and maintain blood pressure. Long-term use of these medicines has been linked to an increased risk of death in some people. Talk to your health care provider about the benefits and risks of these drugs.Other medicines.Your health care provider may prescribe other medicines to treat specific symptoms. For example, some people may receive nitrates for chest pain, statins to lower cholesterol or blood thinners to help prevent blood clots.Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.These drugs relax blood vessels to lower blood pressure, improve blood flow and decrease the strain on the heart.

This is more common when you've just started a new medicine or when your condition is getting worse.You may be admitted to the hospital if you have a flare-up of heart failure symptoms. While in the hospital, you may receive:Medicines to relieve your symptoms.More medicines to help your heart pump better.Oxygen through a mask or small tubes placed in your nose.Medicines to relieve your symptoms.More medicines to help your heart pump better.Oxygen through a mask or small tubes placed in your nose.If you have severe heart failure, you may need to use supplemental oxygen for a long time.Surgery or other proceduresSurgery or other treatment to place a heart device may be recommended to treat the problem that led to heart failure.Surgery or other procedures for heart failure may include:Coronary bypass surgery.You may need this surgery if severely blocked arteries are causing your heart failure. The surgery involves taking a healthy blood vessel from the leg, arm or chest and connecting it below and above the blocked arteries in the heart. The new pathway improves blood flow to the heart muscle.Heart valve repair or replacement.If a damaged heart valve causes heart failure, your provider may recommend repairing or replacing the valve. There are many different types of heart valve repair. The type needed depends on the cause of the heart valve problem.Heart valve repair or replacement may be done as open-heart or minimally invasive surgery.Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).AnICDis used to prevent complications of heart failure. It isn't a treatment for heart failure itself. AnICDis a device similar to a pacemaker. It's implanted under the skin in the chest with wires leading through the veins and into the heart.TheICDmonitors the heartbeat. If the heart starts beating at a dangerous rhythm, theICDtries to correct the beat. If the heart stops, the device shocks it back into regular rhythm. AnICDcan also work as a pacemaker and speed up a slow heartbeat.Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).Also called biventricular pacing,CRTis a treatment for heart failure in people whose lower heart chambers aren't pumping in sync with each other. A device sends electrical signals to the lower heart chambers. The signals tell the chambers to squeeze in a more coordinated way. This improves the pumping of blood out of the heart.CRTmay be used with anICD.Ventricular assist device (VAD).AVADhelps pump blood from the lower chambers of the heart to the rest of the body. It's also called a mechanical circulatory support device. Although aVADcan be placed in one or both lower chambers of the heart, it's usually placed in the lower left one.Your health care provider may recommend aVADif you're waiting for a heart transplant. Sometimes, aVADis used as a permanent treatment for people who have heart failure but who aren't good candidates for a heart transplant.Heart transplant.Some people have such severe heart failure that surgery or medicines don't help. These people may need to have their hearts replaced with a healthy donor heart.A heart transplant isn't the right treatment for everyone. A team of health care providers at a transplant center helps determine whether the procedure may be safe and beneficial for you.Coronary bypass surgery.You may need this surgery if severely blocked arteries are causing your heart failure.

A team of health care providers at a transplant center helps determine whether the procedure may be safe and beneficial for you.Symptom care and end-of-life careYour health care provider may recommend special medical care to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. This is called palliative care. Anyone who has a serious or life-threatening illness can benefit from this type of care. It can be used to treat symptoms of the disease or to ease the side effects of treatment.In some people with heart failure, medicines no longer work and a heart transplant or device isn't an option. If this occurs, special end-of-life care may be recommended. This is called hospice care.Hospice care allows family and friends \u2014 with the aid of nurses, social workers and trained volunteers \u2014 to care for and comfort a loved one. Hospice care is available in your home or in nursing homes and assisted living centers.Hospice care provides the following for those who are sick and their loved ones:Emotional support.Psychological support.Spiritual support.Emotional support.Psychological support.Spiritual support.Although it can be difficult, discussing end-of-life issues with your family and medical team is important. Part of this discussion will likely involve an advance care directive. This is a general term for spoken and written instructions you give concerning your medical care, should you become unable to speak for yourself.If you have anICD, one important consideration to discuss with your family and health care team is whether theICDshould be turned off so that it can't deliver shocks to make your heart continue beating.ICDICDMore InformationHeart failure care at Mayo ClinicCoronary artery bypass surgeryHeart transplantImplantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)PacemakerPalliative careVentricular assist deviceShow more related informationMore InformationHeart failure care at Mayo ClinicCoronary artery bypass surgeryHeart transplantImplantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)PacemakerPalliative careVentricular assist deviceShow more related informationHeart failure care at Mayo ClinicCoronary artery bypass surgeryHeart transplantImplantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)PacemakerPalliative careVentricular assist deviceHeart failure care at Mayo ClinicHeart failure care at Mayo ClinicCoronary artery bypass surgeryCoronary artery bypass surgeryHeart transplantHeart transplantImplantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)PacemakerPacemakerPalliative carePalliative careVentricular assist deviceVentricular assist deviceShow more related informationRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

    "428.32: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction": "Treatment of heart failure may depend on the cause. Treatment often includes lifestyle changes and medicines. If another health condition is causing the heart to fail, treating it may reverse heart failure.Some people with heart failure need surgery to open blocked arteries or to place a device to help the heart work better.With treatment, symptoms of heart failure may improve.MedicationsA combination of medicines may be used to treat heart failure. The specific medicines used depend on the cause of heart failure and the symptoms. Medicines to treat heart failure include:Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.These drugs relax blood vessels to lower blood pressure, improve blood flow and decrease the strain on the heart. Examples include enalapril (Vasotec, Epaned), lisinopril (Zestril, Qbrelis) and captopril.Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).These drugs have many of the same benefits asACEinhibitors. They may be an option for people who can't tolerateACEinhibitors. They include losartan (Cozaar), valsartan (Diovan) and candesartan (Atacand).Angiotensin receptor plus neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs).This medicine uses two blood pressure drugs to treat heart failure. The combination medicine is sacubitril-valsartan (Entresto). It's used to treat some people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. It may help prevent the need for a hospital stay in those people.Beta blockers.These medicines slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure. They reduce the symptoms of heart failure and help the heart work better. If you have heart failure, beta blockers may help you live longer. Examples include carvedilol (Coreg), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL, Kapspargo Sprinkle) and bisoprolol.Diuretics.Often called water pills, these medicines make you urinate more frequently. This helps prevent fluid buildup in your body. Diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix, Furoscix), also decrease fluid in the lungs, so it's easier to breathe.Some diuretics make the body lose potassium and magnesium. Your health care provider may recommend supplements to treat this. If you're taking a diuretic, you may have regular blood tests to check your potassium and magnesium levels.Potassium-sparing diuretics.Also called aldosterone antagonists, these drugs include spironolactone (Aldactone, Carospir) and eplerenone (Inspra). They may help people with severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) live longer.Unlike some other diuretics, these medicines can raise the level of potassium in the blood to dangerous levels. Talk to your health care provider about your diet and potassium intake.Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.These medicines help lower blood sugar. They are often prescribed with diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. But they're also one of the first treatments for heart failure. That's because several studies showed that the medicine lowered the risk of hospital stays and death in people with certain types of heart failure \u2014 even if they didn't have diabetes. These medicines include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance).Digoxin (Lanoxin).This drug, also called digitalis, helps the heart squeeze better to pump blood. It also tends to slow the heartbeat. Digoxin reduces heart failure symptoms in people withHFrEF. It may be more likely to be given to someone with a heart rhythm problem, such as atrial fibrillation.Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (BiDil).This drug combination helps relax blood vessels. It may be added to your treatment plan if you have severe heart failure symptoms andACEinhibitors or beta blockers haven't helped.Vericiguat (Verquvo).This medicine for chronic heart failure is taken once a day by mouth. It's a type of drug called an oral soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator. In studies, people with high-risk heart failure who took this medicine had fewer hospital stays for heart failure and heart disease-related deaths compared with those who got a dummy pill.Positive inotropes.These medicines may be given by IV to people with certain types of severe heart failure who are in the hospital. Positive inotropes can help the heart pump blood better and maintain blood pressure. Long-term use of these medicines has been linked to an increased risk of death in some people. Talk to your health care provider about the benefits and risks of these drugs.Other medicines.Your health care provider may prescribe other medicines to treat specific symptoms. For example, some people may receive nitrates for chest pain, statins to lower cholesterol or blood thinners to help prevent blood clots.Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.These drugs relax blood vessels to lower blood pressure, improve blood flow and decrease the strain on the heart.

This is more common when you've just started a new medicine or when your condition is getting worse.You may be admitted to the hospital if you have a flare-up of heart failure symptoms. While in the hospital, you may receive:Medicines to relieve your symptoms.More medicines to help your heart pump better.Oxygen through a mask or small tubes placed in your nose.Medicines to relieve your symptoms.More medicines to help your heart pump better.Oxygen through a mask or small tubes placed in your nose.If you have severe heart failure, you may need to use supplemental oxygen for a long time.Surgery or other proceduresSurgery or other treatment to place a heart device may be recommended to treat the problem that led to heart failure.Surgery or other procedures for heart failure may include:Coronary bypass surgery.You may need this surgery if severely blocked arteries are causing your heart failure. The surgery involves taking a healthy blood vessel from the leg, arm or chest and connecting it below and above the blocked arteries in the heart. The new pathway improves blood flow to the heart muscle.Heart valve repair or replacement.If a damaged heart valve causes heart failure, your provider may recommend repairing or replacing the valve. There are many different types of heart valve repair. The type needed depends on the cause of the heart valve problem.Heart valve repair or replacement may be done as open-heart or minimally invasive surgery.Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).AnICDis used to prevent complications of heart failure. It isn't a treatment for heart failure itself. AnICDis a device similar to a pacemaker. It's implanted under the skin in the chest with wires leading through the veins and into the heart.TheICDmonitors the heartbeat. If the heart starts beating at a dangerous rhythm, theICDtries to correct the beat. If the heart stops, the device shocks it back into regular rhythm. AnICDcan also work as a pacemaker and speed up a slow heartbeat.Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).Also called biventricular pacing,CRTis a treatment for heart failure in people whose lower heart chambers aren't pumping in sync with each other. A device sends electrical signals to the lower heart chambers. The signals tell the chambers to squeeze in a more coordinated way. This improves the pumping of blood out of the heart.CRTmay be used with anICD.Ventricular assist device (VAD).AVADhelps pump blood from the lower chambers of the heart to the rest of the body. It's also called a mechanical circulatory support device. Although aVADcan be placed in one or both lower chambers of the heart, it's usually placed in the lower left one.Your health care provider may recommend aVADif you're waiting for a heart transplant. Sometimes, aVADis used as a permanent treatment for people who have heart failure but who aren't good candidates for a heart transplant.Heart transplant.Some people have such severe heart failure that surgery or medicines don't help. These people may need to have their hearts replaced with a healthy donor heart.A heart transplant isn't the right treatment for everyone. A team of health care providers at a transplant center helps determine whether the procedure may be safe and beneficial for you.Coronary bypass surgery.You may need this surgery if severely blocked arteries are causing your heart failure.

A team of health care providers at a transplant center helps determine whether the procedure may be safe and beneficial for you.Symptom care and end-of-life careYour health care provider may recommend special medical care to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. This is called palliative care. Anyone who has a serious or life-threatening illness can benefit from this type of care. It can be used to treat symptoms of the disease or to ease the side effects of treatment.In some people with heart failure, medicines no longer work and a heart transplant or device isn't an option. If this occurs, special end-of-life care may be recommended. This is called hospice care.Hospice care allows family and friends \u2014 with the aid of nurses, social workers and trained volunteers \u2014 to care for and comfort a loved one. Hospice care is available in your home or in nursing homes and assisted living centers.Hospice care provides the following for those who are sick and their loved ones:Emotional support.Psychological support.Spiritual support.Emotional support.Psychological support.Spiritual support.Although it can be difficult, discussing end-of-life issues with your family and medical team is important.

A metal clip is placed on the aneurysm to stop the blood flow to it.Endovascular embolization.The surgeon inserts a catheter into an artery and threads it to your brain. Detachable platinum coils are guided through the catheter and placed in the aneurysm. The coils fill the aneurysm, reducing blood flow into the aneurysm sac and causing the blood to clot. Different types of coils have been developed to treat various aneurysms.Other endovascular treatments.Certain aneurysms can be treated with endovascular embolization that uses newer technology such as stent-assisted or balloon-assisted coiling or devices that divert blood flow.Surgery.The surgeon makes an incision in the scalp and locates the brain aneurysm.

This can cause stroke if it reduces the blood flow below a certain level. When this complication occurs, strokes may be avoided by raising the blood pressure with intravenous medications or increasing the width of the blood vessels in the brain with medications.Another common complication is hydrocephalus which is an accumulation of fluid in brain spaces. This problem can be treated with drains inserted in the head (ventriculostomy catheter) or in the lower back (lumbar drains).Sometimes, procedures need to be repeated.

    "437.0: Cerebral atherosclerosis": "Lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising, may be all that is needed to treat atherosclerosis. But sometimes, medication or surgical procedures may be needed.MedicationsMany different drugs are available to slow \u2014 or even reverse \u2014 the effects of atherosclerosis. Here are some medications used to treat atherosclerosis:Statins and other cholesterol drugs.Aggressively lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol \u2014 the \"bad\" cholesterol \u2014 can slow, stop or even reverse the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries.Statins are commonly used to lower cholesterol, improve artery health and prevent atherosclerosis. There are many other types of cholesterol-lowering drugs. They include niacin, fibrates and bile acid sequestrants. You may need more than one type of cholesterol medication.Aspirin.Aspirin helps thin the blood and prevent blood clots. Daily low-dose aspirin therapy may be recommended for the primary prevention of heart attack or stroke in certain people. Daily use of aspirin can have serious side effects, including bleeding in the stomach and intestines. Don't start taking a daily aspirin without talking to your health care provider.Blood pressure medications.Drugs to lower blood pressure don't help reverse atherosclerosis. Instead they prevent or treat complications related to the disease. For example, certain blood pressure medications can help reduce the risk of a heart attack.Other medications.Drugs may be prescribed to control other health conditions \u2014 such as diabetes \u2014 that raise the risk of atherosclerosis. Medications may also be given to treat specific symptoms of atherosclerosis, such as leg pain during exercise.Statins and other cholesterol drugs.Aggressively lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol \u2014 the \"bad\" cholesterol \u2014 can slow, stop or even reverse the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries.Statins are commonly used to lower cholesterol, improve artery health and prevent atherosclerosis.

If you have severe symptoms or a blockage, you may need a procedure or surgery, including:Angioplasty and stent placement.This procedure \u2014 also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) \u2014 helps open a clogged or blocked artery. A long, thin flexible tube (catheter) is inserted in a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist, and guided to the blockage. Then, a balloon on the tip of a catheter can be inflated to open the artery. A mesh tube (stent) is typically used to keep the artery open.Endarterectomy.Sometimes, surgery is needed to remove plaque from the walls of a narrowed artery. When the procedure is done on arteries in the neck (the carotid arteries), it's called a carotid endarterectomy.Fibrinolytic therapy.If a clot in an artery is blocking blood flow, your provider may use a clot-dissolving drug to break it apart.Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.A surgeon takes a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body to create a new path for blood in the heart. The blood then goes around the blocked or narrowed coronary artery.CABGis an open-heart surgery.

    "496: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease": "Many people withCOPDhave mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than smoking cessation. Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, slow progression, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life.COPDQuitting smokingThe most essential step in any treatment plan forCOPDis to quit all smoking. Stopping smoking can keepCOPDfrom getting worse and reducing your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn't easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you've tried to quit and have been unsuccessful.COPDCOPDTalk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. Also, avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible.MedicationsSeveral kinds of medications are used to treat the symptoms and complications ofCOPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.COPDBronchodilatorsBronchodilators are medications that usually come in inhalers \u2014 they relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both.Examples of short-acting bronchodilators include:Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA)Levalbuterol (Xopenex)Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA)Levalbuterol (Xopenex)Examples of long-acting bronchodilators include:Aclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)Arformoterol (Brovana)Formoterol (Perforomist)Indacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)Tiotropium (Spiriva)Salmeterol (Serevent)Umeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)Aclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)Arformoterol (Brovana)Formoterol (Perforomist)Indacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)Tiotropium (Spiriva)Salmeterol (Serevent)Umeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)Inhaled steroidsInhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations ofCOPD. Examples of inhaled steroids include:COPDFluticasone (Flovent HFA)Budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)Fluticasone (Flovent HFA)Budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)Combination inhalersSome medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Examples of these combination inhalers include:Fluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)Fluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)Formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)Fluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)Fluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)Formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)Combination inhalers that include more than one type of bronchodilator also are available. Examples of these include:Aclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)Albuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)Formoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)Glycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)Olodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)Umeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)Aclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)Albuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)Formoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)Glycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)Olodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)Umeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)Oral steroidsFor people who experience periods when theirCOPDbecomes more severe, called moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids may prevent further worsening ofCOPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection.COPDCOPDPhosphodiesterase-4 inhibitorsA medication approved for people with severeCOPDand symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss.COPDTheophyllineWhen other treatment has been ineffective or if cost is a factor, theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Theochron), a less expensive medication, may help improve breathing and prevent episodes of worseningCOPD. Side effects are dose related and may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor, so tests are used to monitor blood levels of the medication.COPDAntibioticsRespiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravateCOPDsymptoms. Antibiotics help treat episodes of worseningCOPD, but they aren't generally recommended for prevention. Some studies show that certain antibiotics, such as azithromycin (Zithromax), prevent episodes of worseningCOPD, but side effects and antibiotic resistance may limit their use.COPDCOPDCOPDLung therapiesDoctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severeCOPD:COPDOxygen therapy.If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices that deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town.Some people withCOPDuse oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the onlyCOPDtherapy proved to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options.Pulmonary rehabilitation program.These programs generally combine education, exercise training, nutrition advice and counseling. You'll work with a variety of specialists, who can tailor your rehabilitation program to meet your needs.Pulmonary rehabilitation after episodes of worseningCOPDmay reduce readmission to the hospital, increase your ability to participate in everyday activities and improve your quality of life.

A noninvasive ventilation therapy machine with a mask helps to improve breathing and decrease retention of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) that may lead to acute respiratory failure and hospitalization. More research is needed to determine the best ways to use this therapy.Managing exacerbationsEven with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don't receive prompt treatment.Exacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other triggers of inflammation. Whatever the cause, it's important to seek prompt medical help if you notice a sustained increase in coughing or a change in your mucus, or if you have a harder time breathing.When exacerbations occur, you may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, your doctor can talk with you about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking; taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications; getting your annual flu vaccine; and avoiding air pollution whenever possible.SurgerySurgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren't helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include:Lung volume reduction surgery.In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival.Endoscopic lung volume reduction \u2014 a minimally invasive procedure \u2014 has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat people withCOPD. A tiny one-way endobronchial valve is placed in the lung, allowing the most damaged lobe to shrink so that the healthier part of the lung has more space to expand and function.Lung transplant.Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it's a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and you'll need to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications.Bullectomy.Large air spaces (bullae) form in the lungs when the walls of the air sacs (alveoli) are destroyed. These bullae can become very large and cause breathing problems. In a bullectomy, doctors remove bullae from the lungs to help improve air flow.Lung volume reduction surgery.In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs.

    "518.0: Pulmonary embolism": "Treatment of a pulmonary embolism focuses on keeping the blood clot from getting bigger and preventing new clots from forming. Prompt treatment is essential to prevent serious complications or death.Treatment can include medicines, surgery and other procedures, and ongoing care.MedicinesMedicines include different types of blood thinners and clot dissolvers.Blood thinners.These blood-thinning medicines called anticoagulants prevent existing clots from getting bigger and new clots from forming while your body works to break up the clots. Heparin is a frequently used anticoagulant that can be given through a vein or injected under the skin. It acts quickly and is often given along with an oral anticoagulant, such as warfarin (Jantovin), until the oral medicine becomes effective. This can take several days.Newer oral anticoagulants work more quickly and have fewer interactions with other medicines. Some have the advantage of being given by mouth until they're effective, without the need for heparin. However, all anticoagulants have side effects, and bleeding is the most common.Clot dissolvers.While clots usually dissolve on their own, sometimes thrombolytics \u2014 medicines that dissolve clots \u2014 given through a vein can dissolve clots quickly. Because these clot-busting medicines can cause sudden and severe bleeding, they usually are reserved for life-threatening situations.Blood thinners.These blood-thinning medicines called anticoagulants prevent existing clots from getting bigger and new clots from forming while your body works to break up the clots.

The filter can help keep clots from going to your lungs. This procedure is usually only used for people who can't take anticoagulant drugs or those who get blood clots even with the use of anticoagulants. Some filters can be removed when no longer needed.Clot removal.If you have a large, life-threatening clot in your lung, your health care provider may remove it using a thin, flexible catheter threaded through your blood vessels.Clot removal.Vein filter.A catheter also can be used to position a filter in the body's main vein, the inferior vena cava, that leads from your legs to the right side of your heart.

This reinforces the lower esophageal sphincter, making it less likely that acid will back up in the esophagus.GERDSubstitute for esophageal sphincterEnlarge imageCloseSubstitute for esophageal sphincterSubstitute for esophageal sphincterThe LINX device is an expandable ring of magnetic beads that keeps stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus, but allows food to pass into the stomach.Substitute for esophageal sphincterEnlarge imageSubstitute for esophageal sphincterEnlarge imageEnlarge imageCloseSubstitute for esophageal sphincterSubstitute for esophageal sphincterThe LINX device is an expandable ring of magnetic beads that keeps stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus, but allows food to pass into the stomach.CloseSubstitute for esophageal sphincterSubstitute for esophageal sphincterThe LINX device is an expandable ring of magnetic beads that keeps stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus, but allows food to pass into the stomach.CloseSubstitute for esophageal sphincterSubstitute for esophageal sphincterThe LINX device is an expandable ring of magnetic beads that keeps stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus, but allows food to pass into the stomach.CloseCloseCloseSubstitute for esophageal sphincterSubstitute for esophageal sphincterThe LINX device is an expandable ring of magnetic beads that keeps stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus, but allows food to pass into the stomach.Substitute for esophageal sphincterThe LINX device is an expandable ring of magnetic beads that keeps stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus, but allows food to pass into the stomach.Your doctor is likely to recommend that you first try lifestyle changes and nonprescription medications. If you don't experience relief within a few weeks, your doctor might recommend prescription medication and additional testing.Nonprescription medicationsOptions include:Antacids that neutralize stomach acid.Antacids containing calcium carbonate, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief. But antacids alone won't heal an inflamed esophagus damaged by stomach acid. Overuse of some antacids can cause side effects, such as diarrhea or sometimes kidney problems.Medications to reduce acid production.These medications \u2014 known as histamine (H-2) blockers \u2014 include cimetidine (Tagamet HB), famotidine (Pepcid AC) and nizatidine (Axid AR). H-2 blockers don't act as quickly as antacids, but they provide longer relief and may decrease acid production from the stomach for up to 12 hours. Stronger versions are available by prescription.Medications that block acid production and heal the esophagus.These medications \u2014 known as proton pump inhibitors \u2014 are stronger acid blockers than H-2 blockers and allow time for damaged esophageal tissue to heal. Nonprescription proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24 HR), omeprazole (Prilosec OTC) and esomeprazole (Nexium 24 HR).Antacids that neutralize stomach acid.Antacids containing calcium carbonate, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief.

Side effects from these medications are generally mild and well tolerated.Prescription-strength proton pump inhibitors.These include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and dexlansoprazole (Dexilant).Although generally well tolerated, these medications might cause diarrhea, headaches, nausea, or in rare instances, low vitamin B-12 or magnesium levels.Prescription-strength proton pump inhibitors.These include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and dexlansoprazole (Dexilant).Prescription-strength proton pump inhibitors.Although generally well tolerated, these medications might cause diarrhea, headaches, nausea, or in rare instances, low vitamin B-12 or magnesium levels.Prescription-strength H-2 blockers.These include prescription-strength famotidine and nizatidine.

But if medications don't help or you wish to avoid long-term medication use, your doctor might recommend:GERDFundoplication.The surgeon wraps the top of your stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter, to tighten the muscle and prevent reflux. Fundoplication is usually done with a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure. The wrapping of the top part of the stomach can be complete (Nissen fundoplication) or partial. The most common partial procedure is the Toupet fundoplication. Your surgeon will recommend the type that is best for you.LINX device.A ring of tiny magnetic beads is wrapped around the junction of the stomach and esophagus. The magnetic attraction between the beads is strong enough to keep the junction closed to refluxing acid, but weak enough to allow food to pass through. The LINX device can be implanted using minimally invasive surgery. The magnetic beads do not have an effect on airport security or magnetic resonance imaging.Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF).This new procedure involves tightening the lower esophageal sphincter by creating a partial wrap around the lower esophagus using polypropylene fasteners. TIF is performed through the mouth by using an endoscope and requires no surgical incision. Its advantages include quick recovery time and high tolerance.If you have a large hiatal hernia,TIFalone is not an option. However,TIFmay be possible if it is combined with laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair.Fundoplication.The surgeon wraps the top of your stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter, to tighten the muscle and prevent reflux.

    "530.82: Esophageal varices": "The primary aim in treating esophageal varices is to prevent bleeding. Bleeding esophageal varices are life-threatening. If bleeding occurs, treatments are available to try to stop the bleeding.Treatment to prevent bleedingTreatments to lower blood pressure in the portal vein may reduce the risk of bleeding esophageal varices. Treatments may include:Medicines to reduce pressure in the portal vein.A type of blood pressure drug called a beta blocker may help reduce blood pressure in your portal vein. This can decrease the likelihood of bleeding. Beta blocker medicines include propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL) and nadolol (Corgard).Using elastic bands to tie off bleeding veins.If your esophageal varices appear to have a high risk of bleeding, or if you've had bleeding from varices before, your health care provider might recommend a procedure called endoscopic band ligation.Using an endoscope, the provider uses suction to pull the varices into a chamber at the end of the scope and wraps them with an elastic band. This essentially \"strangles\" the veins so that they can't bleed. Endoscopic band ligation carries a small risk of complications, such as bleeding and scarring of the esophagus.Medicines to reduce pressure in the portal vein.A type of blood pressure drug called a beta blocker may help reduce blood pressure in your portal vein.

This essentially \"strangles\" the veins so that they can't bleed. Endoscopic band ligation carries a small risk of complications, such as bleeding and scarring of the esophagus.Treatment if you're bleedingBleeding esophageal varices are life-threatening, and immediate treatment is essential. Treatments used to stop bleeding and reverse the effects of blood loss include:Using elastic bands to tie off bleeding veins.Your provider may wrap elastic bands around the esophageal varices during an endoscopy.Taking medicines to slow blood flow into the portal vein.Medicines such as octreotide (Sandostatin) and vasopressin (Vasostrict) slow the flow of blood to the portal vein. Medicine is usually continued for up to five days after a bleeding episode.Diverting blood flow away from the portal vein.If medicine and endoscopy treatments don't stop the bleeding, your provider might recommend a procedure called transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).The shunt is an opening that is created between the portal vein and the hepatic vein, which carries blood from your liver to your heart. The shunt reduces pressure in the portal vein and often stops bleeding from esophageal varices.ButTIPScan cause serious complications, including liver failure and mental confusion. These symptoms can develop when toxins that the liver normally would filter are passed through the shunt directly into the bloodstream.TIPSis mainly used when all other treatments have failed or as a temporary measure in people awaiting a liver transplant.Placing pressure on varices to stop bleeding.If medicine and endoscopy treatments don't work, your provider may try to stop bleeding by applying pressure to the esophageal varices. One way to temporarily stop bleeding is by inflating a balloon to put pressure on the varices for up to 24 hours, a procedure called balloon tamponade. Balloon tamponade is a temporary measure before other treatments can be performed, such asTIPS.This procedure carries a high risk of bleeding recurrence after the balloon is deflated. Balloon tamponade also may cause serious complications, including a rupture in the esophagus, which can lead to death.Restoring blood volume.You might be given a transfusion to replace lost blood and a clotting factor to stop bleeding.Preventing infection.There is an increased risk of infection with bleeding, so you'll likely be given an antibiotic to prevent infection.Replacing the diseased liver with a healthy one.Liver transplant is an option for people with severe liver disease or those who experience recurrent bleeding of esophageal varices. Although liver transplantation is often successful, the number of people awaiting transplants far outnumbers the available organs.Using elastic bands to tie off bleeding veins.Your provider may wrap elastic bands around the esophageal varices during an endoscopy.Using elastic bands to tie off bleeding veins.Taking medicines to slow blood flow into the portal vein.Medicines such as octreotide (Sandostatin) and vasopressin (Vasostrict) slow the flow of blood to the portal vein.

Beta blockers and endoscopic band ligation are the recommended treatments to help prevent re-bleeding.After initial banding treatment, your provider typically repeats your upper endoscopy at regular intervals. If necessary, more banding may be done until the esophageal varices are gone or are small enough to reduce the risk of further bleeding.Potential future treatmentResearchers are exploring an experimental emergency therapy to stop bleeding from esophageal varices that involves spraying an adhesive powder. The hemostatic powder is given through a catheter during an endoscopy. When sprayed on the esophagus, hemostatic powder sticks to the varices and may stop bleeding.Another potential way to stop bleeding when all other measures fail is to use self-expanding metal stents (SEMS).SEMScan be placed during an endoscopy and stop bleeding by placing pressure on the bleeding esophageal varices.SEMSHowever,SEMScould damage tissue and can migrate after being placed. The stent is typically removed within seven days and bleeding could recur.

    "536.3: Gastroparesis": "Treating gastroparesis begins with identifying and treating the underlying condition. If diabetes is causing your gastroparesis, your doctor can work with you to help you control it.Changes to your dietMaintaining adequate nutrition is the most important goal in the treatment of gastroparesis. Many people can manage gastroparesis with dietary changes. Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian who can work with you to find foods that are easier for you to digest. This can help you to get enough calories and nutrients from the food you eat.A dietitian might suggest that you try to:Eat smaller meals more frequentlyChew food thoroughlyEat well-cooked fruits and vegetables rather than raw fruits and vegetablesAvoid fibrous fruits and vegetables, such as oranges and broccoli, which may cause bezoarsChoose mostly low-fat foods, but if you can tolerate fat, add small servings of fatty foods to your dietTry soups and pureed foods if liquids are easier for you to swallowDrink about 34 to 51 ounces (1 to 1.5 liters) of water a dayExercise gently after you eat, such as going for a walkAvoid carbonated drinks, alcohol and smokingTry to avoid lying down for two hours after a mealTake a multivitamin dailyEat smaller meals more frequentlyChew food thoroughlyEat well-cooked fruits and vegetables rather than raw fruits and vegetablesAvoid fibrous fruits and vegetables, such as oranges and broccoli, which may cause bezoarsChoose mostly low-fat foods, but if you can tolerate fat, add small servings of fatty foods to your dietTry soups and pureed foods if liquids are easier for you to swallowDrink about 34 to 51 ounces (1 to 1.5 liters) of water a dayExercise gently after you eat, such as going for a walkAvoid carbonated drinks, alcohol and smokingTry to avoid lying down for two hours after a mealTake a multivitamin dailyAsk your dietitian for a comprehensive list of foods recommended for people with gastropareses.

Erythromycin may lose its effectiveness over time, and can cause side effects, such as diarrhea.A newer medication, domperidone, with fewer side effects, is also available with restricted access.Medications to control nausea and vomiting.Drugs that help ease nausea and vomiting include diphenhydramine (Benadryl, others) and ondansetron (Zofran).

In these situations, doctors may recommend a feeding tube (jejunostomy tube) be placed in the small intestine. Or doctors may recommend a gastric venting tube to help relieve pressure from gastric contents.Feeding tubes can be passed through your nose or mouth or directly into your small intestine through your skin. The tube is usually temporary and is only used when gastroparesis is severe or when blood sugar levels can't be controlled by any other method. Some people may require an IV (parenteral) feeding tube that goes directly into a vein in the chest.Treatments under investigationResearchers are continuing to investigate new medications to treat gastroparesis.One example is a new drug in development called Relamorelin. The results of a phase II trial found the drug could speed up gastric emptying and reduce vomiting. The drug is not yet approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but a larger clinical trial is currently underway.A number of new therapies are being tried with the help of endoscopy \u2014 a procedure done with a slender tube (endoscope) that's threaded down the esophagus.One procedure, known as endoscopic pyloromyotomy (gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy, or G-POEM), involves making an incision in the valve or muscular ring between the stomach and small intestine called the pylorus. A channel is then opened from the stomach to the small intestine. This is a relatively recent procedure that shows promise, though additional research is needed.Another type of endoscopic procedure involves placing a small tube (stent) where the stomach connects to the small intestine (duodenum) to keep this connection open.Gastric electrical stimulation and pacingIn gastric electrical stimulation, a surgically implanted device provides electrical stimulation to the stomach muscles to move food more efficiently. Study results have been mixed. However, the device seems to be most helpful for people with diabetic gastroparesis.The FDA allows the device to be used under a compassionate use exemption for those who can't control their gastroparesis symptoms with diet changes or medications. However, larger studies are needed.More InformationGastroparesis care at Mayo ClinicHome enteral nutritionMore InformationGastroparesis care at Mayo ClinicHome enteral nutritionGastroparesis care at Mayo ClinicHome enteral nutritionGastroparesis care at Mayo ClinicGastroparesis care at Mayo ClinicHome enteral nutritionHome enteral nutritionRequest an appointmentRequest an appointment",
    "571.2: Cirrhosis": "Treatment for cirrhosis depends on the cause and extent of your liver damage. The goals of treatment are to slow the progression of scar tissue in the liver and to prevent or treat symptoms and complications of cirrhosis. You may need to be hospitalized if you have severe liver damage.Treatment for the underlying cause of cirrhosisIn early cirrhosis, it may be possible to minimize damage to the liver by treating the underlying cause. The options include:Treatment for alcohol dependency.People with cirrhosis caused by excessive alcohol use should try to stop drinking. If stopping alcohol use is difficult, your health care provider may recommend a treatment program for alcohol addiction. If you have cirrhosis, it is very important to stop drinking since any amount of alcohol is toxic to the liver.Weight loss.People with cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease may become healthier if they lose weight and control their blood sugar levels.Medicines to control hepatitis.Medicines may limit further damage to liver cells caused by hepatitis B or C through specific treatment of these viruses.Medicines to control other causes and symptoms of cirrhosis.Medicines may slow the progression of certain types of liver cirrhosis. For example, for people with primary biliary cholangitis that is diagnosed early, medicine may significantly delay progression to cirrhosis.Treatment for alcohol dependency.People with cirrhosis caused by excessive alcohol use should try to stop drinking.

For example, for people with primary biliary cholangitis that is diagnosed early, medicine may significantly delay progression to cirrhosis.Medicines to control other causes and symptoms of cirrhosis.Other medicines can relieve certain symptoms, such as itching, fatigue and pain. Nutritional supplements may be prescribed to counter malnutrition associated with cirrhosis. Supplements also can help prevent weak bones, known as osteoporosis.Treatment for complications of cirrhosisYour health care provider will work to treat any complications of cirrhosis, including:A buildup of fluid in your body.A low-sodium diet and medicine to prevent fluid buildup in the body may help control ascites and swelling. More-severe fluid buildup may require procedures to drain the fluid or surgery to relieve pressure.Portal hypertension.Certain blood pressure medicines may control increased pressure in the veins that supply the liver, called portal hypertension, and prevent severe bleeding. Your provider will regularly perform an upper endoscopy to look for enlarged veins in the esophagus or stomach that may bleed. These veins are known as varices.If you develop varices, you likely will need medicine to lower the risk of bleeding. If you have signs that the varices are bleeding or are likely to bleed, you may need a procedure known as band ligation. Band ligation can stop the bleeding or reduce the risk of further bleeding. In severe cases, you may need a small tube \u2014 a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt \u2014 placed in your vein to reduce blood pressure in your liver.Infections.You may receive antibiotics or other treatments for infections. Your provider also is likely to recommend vaccinations for influenza, pneumonia and hepatitis.Increased liver cancer risk.Your provider will likely recommend regular blood tests and ultrasound exams to look for signs of liver cancer.Hepatic encephalopathy.You may be prescribed medicines to help reduce the buildup of toxins in your blood caused by poor liver function.A buildup of fluid in your body.A low-sodium diet and medicine to prevent fluid buildup in the body may help control ascites and swelling.

A liver transplant is a procedure to replace your liver with a healthy liver from a deceased donor or with part of a liver from a living donor. Cirrhosis is one of the most common reasons for a liver transplant. Candidates for liver transplant have extensive testing to determine whether they are healthy enough to have a good outcome following surgery.Historically, those with alcoholic cirrhosis have not been liver transplant candidates because of the risk that they will return to harmful drinking after transplant. Recent studies, however, suggest that carefully selected people with severe alcoholic cirrhosis have post-transplant survival rates similar to those of liver transplant recipients with other types of liver disease.For transplant to be an option if you have alcoholic cirrhosis, you would need to:Find a program that works with people who have alcoholic cirrhosis.Meet the requirements of the program. These would include lifelong commitment to alcohol abstinence as well as other requirements of the specific transplant center.Find a program that works with people who have alcoholic cirrhosis.Meet the requirements of the program. These would include lifelong commitment to alcohol abstinence as well as other requirements of the specific transplant center.Potential future treatmentsScientists are working to expand current treatments for cirrhosis, but success has been limited. Because cirrhosis has a variety of causes and complications, there are many potential avenues of approach. A combination of increased screening, lifestyle changes and new medicines may improve outcomes for people with liver damage, if started early.Researchers are working on therapies that will specifically target liver cells, helping to slow or even reverse the fibrosis that leads to cirrhosis. However, no targeted therapy is quite ready.More InformationCirrhosis care at Mayo ClinicLiver transplantCirrhosis FAQsMore InformationCirrhosis care at Mayo ClinicLiver transplantCirrhosis FAQsCirrhosis care at Mayo ClinicLiver transplantCirrhosis FAQsCirrhosis care at Mayo ClinicCirrhosis care at Mayo ClinicLiver transplantLiver transplantCirrhosis FAQsCirrhosis FAQsRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

    "576.1: Ascending cholangitis": "Treatments for primary sclerosing cholangitis focus on managing complications and monitoring liver damage. Many medications have been studied in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis, but so far none have been found to slow or reverse the liver damage associated with this disease.Treatment for itchingBile acid sequestrants.Medications that bind to bile acids \u2014 the substances thought to cause itching in liver disease \u2014 are the first line treatment for itching in primary sclerosing cholangitis.Antibiotics.If you have trouble tolerating a bile acid-binding drug or if it doesn't help, your doctor may prescribe rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, others), an antibacterial drug. Exactly how rifampin reduces itching is unknown, but it may block the brain's response to itch-inducing chemicals in your circulation.Antihistamines.This type of medication may help reduce mild itching caused by primary sclerosing cholangitis. Whether these medications are effective for this condition is unknown.Antihistamines may worsen the liver disease symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth. On the other hand, antihistamines can help with sleep if itching keeps you awake.Opioid antagonists.Itching related to liver disease may also respond to opioid antagonist drugs, such as naltrexone. Like rifampin, these drugs seem to reduce the itch sensation by acting on your brain.Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).Also known as ursodiol,UDCAis a naturally occurring bile acid that may help relieve itching symptoms caused by liver disease by increasing the absorbability of bile.Bile acid sequestrants.Medications that bind to bile acids \u2014 the substances thought to cause itching in liver disease \u2014 are the first line treatment for itching in primary sclerosing cholangitis.Bile acid sequestrants.Antibiotics.If you have trouble tolerating a bile acid-binding drug or if it doesn't help, your doctor may prescribe rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, others), an antibacterial drug.

To prevent and treat these infections, people with primary sclerosing cholangitis may take repeated courses of antibiotics or continue taking antibiotics for long periods.Before any procedure that could cause an infection, such as an endoscopic procedure or abdominal surgery, you'll also need to take antibiotics.Nutrition supportPrimary sclerosing cholangitis makes it difficult for your body to absorb certain vitamins. Even though you may eat a healthy diet, you may find that you can't get all the nutrients you need.Your doctor may recommend vitamin supplements that you take as tablets or that you receive as an infusion through a vein in your arm. If the disease weakens your bones, you may take calcium and vitamin D supplements as well.Treatment for bile duct blockagesBlockages that occur in your bile ducts may be due to disease progression but can be a sign of cancer of the bile duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can help determine the cause, and bile duct blockage can be treated with:Balloon dilation.This procedure can open blockages in the larger bile ducts outside the liver. In balloon dilation, your doctor runs a slender tube with an inflatable balloon at its tip (balloon catheter) through an endoscope and into a blocked bile duct. Once the balloon catheter is in place, the balloon is inflated.Stent placement.In this procedure, your doctor uses an endoscope and attached instruments to place a small plastic tube called a stent in a blocked bile duct to hold the duct open.Balloon dilation.This procedure can open blockages in the larger bile ducts outside the liver.

During a liver transplant, surgeons remove your diseased liver and replace it with a healthy liver from a donor.A liver transplant is reserved for people with liver failure or other severe complications of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Though uncommon, it's possible for primary sclerosing cholangitis to recur after a liver transplant.More InformationPrimary sclerosing cholangitis care at Mayo ClinicLiver transplantMore InformationPrimary sclerosing cholangitis care at Mayo ClinicLiver transplantPrimary sclerosing cholangitis care at Mayo ClinicLiver transplantPrimary sclerosing cholangitis care at Mayo ClinicPrimary sclerosing cholangitis care at Mayo ClinicLiver transplantLiver transplantRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

    "576.2: Cholestasis": "The goals of treatment for cholestasis of pregnancy are to ease itching and prevent complications in your baby.Ease itchingTo soothe intense itching, your pregnancy care provider may recommend:Taking a prescription medicine called ursodiol (Actigall, Urso, Urso Forte). This medicine helps to lower the level of bile acids in your blood. Other medicines to relieve itching also may be an option.Soaking itchy areas in cool or lukewarm water.Taking a prescription medicine called ursodiol (Actigall, Urso, Urso Forte). This medicine helps to lower the level of bile acids in your blood. Other medicines to relieve itching also may be an option.Soaking itchy areas in cool or lukewarm water.It's best to talk to your pregnancy care provider before you start any medicines for treating itching.Monitoring your baby's healthCholestasis of pregnancy can potentially cause complications to your pregnancy. Your pregnancy care provider may recommend close monitoring of your baby while you're pregnant.Monitoring may include:Nonstress testing.During a nonstress test, your pregnancy care provider will check your baby's heart rate, and how much the heart rate increases with activity.Fetal biophysical profile (BPP).This series of tests helps monitor your baby's well-being. It provides information about your baby's heart rate, movement, muscle tone, breathing movements and amount of amniotic fluid.Nonstress testing.During a nonstress test, your pregnancy care provider will check your baby's heart rate, and how much the heart rate increases with activity.Nonstress testing.Fetal biophysical profile (BPP).This series of tests helps monitor your baby's well-being. It provides information about your baby's heart rate, movement, muscle tone, breathing movements and amount of amniotic fluid.Fetal biophysical profile (BPP).While the results of these tests can be reassuring, they can't predict the risk of preterm birth or other complications associated with cholestasis of pregnancy.Early deliveryEven if prenatal tests are within standard limits, your pregnancy care provider may suggest inducing labor before your due date. Early term delivery, around 37 weeks, may lower the risk of stillbirth. Vaginal delivery is recommended by induction of labor unless there are other reasons a cesarean section is needed.Future birth controlA history of cholestasis of pregnancy may increase the risk of symptoms returning with contraceptives that contain estrogen, so other methods of birth control are generally recommended. These include progestin-containing contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs) or barrier methods, such as condoms or diaphragms.Request an appointmentRequest an appointment",
    "584.9: Pulmonary edema": "The first treatment for acute pulmonary edema is oxygen. Oxygen flows through a face mask or a flexible plastic tube with two openings (nasal cannula) that deliver oxygen to each nostril. This should ease some symptoms.A health care provider monitors the oxygen level. Sometimes it may be necessary to assist breathing with a machine such as a mechanical ventilator or one that provides positive airway pressure.Depending on the severity of the condition and the reason for the pulmonary edema, treatment might include one or more of the following medications:Diuretics.Diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix), decrease the pressure caused by excess fluid in the heart and lungs.Blood pressure drugs.These help manage high or low blood pressure, which can occur with pulmonary edema. A provider may also prescribe medications that lower the pressure going into or out of the heart. Examples of such medicines are nitroglycerin (Nitromist, Nitrostat, others) and nitroprusside (Nitropress).Inotropes.This type of medication is given through an IV for people in the hospital with severe heart failure. Inotropes improve heart pumping function and maintain blood pressure.Morphine (MS Contin, Infumorph, others).This narcotic may be taken by mouth or given through an IV to relieve shortness of breath and anxiety. But some care providers believe that the risks of morphine may outweigh the benefits. They're more likely to use other drugs.It is important to diagnosis and treat, if possible, any nervous system problems or causes of heart failure.The first treatment for acute pulmonary edema is oxygen.

But kidney damage can continue to worsen even when an underlying condition, such as diabetes mellitus or high blood pressure, has been controlled.Treating complicationsKidney disease complications can be controlled to make you more comfortable. Treatments might include:High blood pressure medications.People with kidney disease can have worsening high blood pressure. Your doctor might recommend medications to lower your blood pressure \u2014 commonly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers \u2014 and to preserve kidney function.High blood pressure medications can initially decrease kidney function and change electrolyte levels, so you might need frequent blood tests to monitor your condition. Your doctor may also recommend a water pill (diuretic) and a low-salt diet.Medications to relieve swelling.People with chronic kidney disease often retain fluids. This can lead to swelling in the legs as well as high blood pressure. Medications called diuretics can help maintain the balance of fluids in your body.Medications to treat anemia.Supplements of the hormone erythropoietin (uh-rith-roe-POI-uh-tin), sometimes with added iron, help produce more red blood cells. This might relieve fatigue and weakness associated with anemia.Medications to lower cholesterol levels.Your doctor might recommend medications called statins to lower your cholesterol. People with chronic kidney disease often have high levels of bad cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease.Medications to protect your bones.Calcium and vitamin D supplements can help prevent weak bones and lower your risk of fracture. You might also take medication known as a phosphate binder to lower the amount of phosphate in your blood and protect your blood vessels from damage by calcium deposits (calcification).A lower protein diet to minimize waste products in your blood.As your body processes protein from foods, it creates waste products that your kidneys must filter from your blood. To reduce the amount of work your kidneys must do, your doctor might recommend eating less protein. A registered dietitian can suggest ways to lower your protein intake while still eating a healthy diet.High blood pressure medications.People with kidney disease can have worsening high blood pressure.

At that point, you need dialysis or a kidney transplant.Dialysis.Dialysis artificially removes waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do this. In hemodialysis, a machine filters waste and excess fluids from your blood.In peritoneal dialysis, a thin tube inserted into your abdomen fills your abdominal cavity with a dialysis solution that absorbs waste and excess fluids. After a time, the dialysis solution drains from your body, carrying the waste with it.Kidney transplant.A kidney transplant involves surgically placing a healthy kidney from a donor into your body. Transplanted kidneys can come from deceased or living donors.After a transplant, you'll need to take medications for the rest of your life to keep your body from rejecting the new organ. You don't need to be on dialysis to have a kidney transplant.Dialysis.Dialysis artificially removes waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do this.

You don't need to be on dialysis to have a kidney transplant.For some who choose not to have dialysis or a kidney transplant, a third option is to treat your kidney failure with conservative measures. Conservative measures likely will include symptom management, advance care planning and care to keep you comfortable (palliative care).Kidney Disease: How kidneys work, Hemodialysis, and Peritoneal dialysisKidney Disease: How kidneys work, Hemodialysis, and Peritoneal dialysis(function () {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkWidget.embed({\"targetId\":\"kaltura-video-1_tmvufeii\",\"wid\":\"_1825021\",\"uiconf_id\":44373111,\"flashvars\":{\"IframeCustomPluginCss1\":\"/-/media/kcms/ux/css/kaltura-player.css\",\"localizationCode\":\"auto\",\"playlistAPI\":{\"kpl0Id\":\"1_tmvufeii\",\"containerPosition\":\"bottom\",\"layout\":\"horizontal\",\"autoContinue\":false},\"autoPlay\":false},\"cache_st\":20200805,\"readyCallback\": function(playerId) {var kdp = document.getElementById(playerId); kdp.addJsListener('doPlay', 'doPlayCallback'); window.inlineReadyCallbackCalled = playerId; }});\n\t\t\t\t\t})();More InformationChronic kidney disease care at Mayo ClinicChronic kidney disease: Is a clinical trial right for me?Deceased-donor kidney transplantHemodialysisKidney transplantLiving-donor kidney transplantNondirected living-donor transplantPeritoneal dialysisPreemptive kidney transplantKidney disease FAQsShow more related informationMore InformationChronic kidney disease care at Mayo ClinicChronic kidney disease: Is a clinical trial right for me?Deceased-donor kidney transplantHemodialysisKidney transplantLiving-donor kidney transplantNondirected living-donor transplantPeritoneal dialysisPreemptive kidney transplantKidney disease FAQsShow more related informationChronic kidney disease care at Mayo ClinicChronic kidney disease: Is a clinical trial right for me?Deceased-donor kidney transplantHemodialysisKidney transplantLiving-donor kidney transplantNondirected living-donor transplantPeritoneal dialysisPreemptive kidney transplantKidney disease FAQsChronic kidney disease care at Mayo ClinicChronic kidney disease care at Mayo ClinicChronic kidney disease: Is a clinical trial right for me?Chronic kidney disease: Is a clinical trial right for me?Deceased-donor kidney transplantDeceased-donor kidney transplantHemodialysisHemodialysisKidney transplantKidney transplantLiving-donor kidney transplantLiving-donor kidney transplantNondirected living-donor transplantNondirected living-donor transplantPeritoneal dialysisPeritoneal dialysisPreemptive kidney transplantPreemptive kidney transplantKidney disease FAQsKidney disease FAQsShow more related informationRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

    "585.9: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease": "Many people withCOPDhave mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than smoking cessation. Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, slow progression, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life.COPDQuitting smokingThe most essential step in any treatment plan forCOPDis to quit all smoking. Stopping smoking can keepCOPDfrom getting worse and reducing your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn't easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you've tried to quit and have been unsuccessful.COPDCOPDTalk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. Also, avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible.MedicationsSeveral kinds of medications are used to treat the symptoms and complications ofCOPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.COPDBronchodilatorsBronchodilators are medications that usually come in inhalers \u2014 they relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both.Examples of short-acting bronchodilators include:Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA)Levalbuterol (Xopenex)Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA)Levalbuterol (Xopenex)Examples of long-acting bronchodilators include:Aclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)Arformoterol (Brovana)Formoterol (Perforomist)Indacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)Tiotropium (Spiriva)Salmeterol (Serevent)Umeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)Aclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)Arformoterol (Brovana)Formoterol (Perforomist)Indacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)Tiotropium (Spiriva)Salmeterol (Serevent)Umeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)Inhaled steroidsInhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations ofCOPD. Examples of inhaled steroids include:COPDFluticasone (Flovent HFA)Budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)Fluticasone (Flovent HFA)Budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)Combination inhalersSome medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Examples of these combination inhalers include:Fluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)Fluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)Formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)Fluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)Fluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)Formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)Combination inhalers that include more than one type of bronchodilator also are available. Examples of these include:Aclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)Albuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)Formoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)Glycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)Olodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)Umeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)Aclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)Albuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)Formoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)Glycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)Olodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)Umeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)Oral steroidsFor people who experience periods when theirCOPDbecomes more severe, called moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids may prevent further worsening ofCOPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection.COPDCOPDPhosphodiesterase-4 inhibitorsA medication approved for people with severeCOPDand symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss.COPDTheophyllineWhen other treatment has been ineffective or if cost is a factor, theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Theochron), a less expensive medication, may help improve breathing and prevent episodes of worseningCOPD. Side effects are dose related and may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor, so tests are used to monitor blood levels of the medication.COPDAntibioticsRespiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravateCOPDsymptoms. Antibiotics help treat episodes of worseningCOPD, but they aren't generally recommended for prevention. Some studies show that certain antibiotics, such as azithromycin (Zithromax), prevent episodes of worseningCOPD, but side effects and antibiotic resistance may limit their use.COPDCOPDCOPDLung therapiesDoctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severeCOPD:COPDOxygen therapy.If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices that deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town.Some people withCOPDuse oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the onlyCOPDtherapy proved to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options.Pulmonary rehabilitation program.These programs generally combine education, exercise training, nutrition advice and counseling. You'll work with a variety of specialists, who can tailor your rehabilitation program to meet your needs.Pulmonary rehabilitation after episodes of worseningCOPDmay reduce readmission to the hospital, increase your ability to participate in everyday activities and improve your quality of life.

A noninvasive ventilation therapy machine with a mask helps to improve breathing and decrease retention of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) that may lead to acute respiratory failure and hospitalization. More research is needed to determine the best ways to use this therapy.Managing exacerbationsEven with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don't receive prompt treatment.Exacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other triggers of inflammation. Whatever the cause, it's important to seek prompt medical help if you notice a sustained increase in coughing or a change in your mucus, or if you have a harder time breathing.When exacerbations occur, you may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, your doctor can talk with you about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking; taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications; getting your annual flu vaccine; and avoiding air pollution whenever possible.SurgerySurgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren't helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include:Lung volume reduction surgery.In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival.Endoscopic lung volume reduction \u2014 a minimally invasive procedure \u2014 has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat people withCOPD. A tiny one-way endobronchial valve is placed in the lung, allowing the most damaged lobe to shrink so that the healthier part of the lung has more space to expand and function.Lung transplant.Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it's a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and you'll need to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications.Bullectomy.Large air spaces (bullae) form in the lungs when the walls of the air sacs (alveoli) are destroyed. These bullae can become very large and cause breathing problems. In a bullectomy, doctors remove bullae from the lungs to help improve air flow.Lung volume reduction surgery.In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs.

    "666.24: Postpartum bleeding": "Treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding is based on a number of factors. These include:Your overall health and medical history.The cause of the condition and how serious it is.How well you tolerate certain medicines or procedures.The chance that your periods will soon become less heavy.Your plans to have children.How the condition affects your lifestyle.Your opinion or personal choices.Your overall health and medical history.The cause of the condition and how serious it is.How well you tolerate certain medicines or procedures.The chance that your periods will soon become less heavy.Your plans to have children.How the condition affects your lifestyle.Your opinion or personal choices.MedicinesMedicines for heavy menstrual bleeding may include:Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs.NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), help reduce menstrual blood loss.NSAIDsmay also make menstrual cramps less painful.Tranexamic acid.Tranexamic acid (Lysteda) helps reduce menstrual blood loss. This medicine only needs to be taken at the time of bleeding.Oral contraceptives.Aside from birth control, oral contraceptives can help regulate menstrual cycles and ease menstrual bleeding that is heavy or lasts a long time.Oral progesterone.The natural hormone progesterone can help fix hormone imbalance and reduce heavy menstrual bleeding. The synthetic form of progesterone is called progestin.HormonalIUD(Mirena, Liletta, others).This intrauterine device releases a type of progestin called levonorgestrel. It makes the uterine lining thin and reduces menstrual blood flow and cramping.Other medicines.Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists are also called GnRH medicines. They help control heavy uterine bleeding. Relugolix combined with an estrogen and progestin (Myfembree) may help control bleeding caused by fibroids. Elagolix with an estrogen and progestin (Oriahnn) is used to treat fibroid-related bleeding. Elagolix alone (Orilissa) may help control bleeding caused by endometriosis.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs.NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), help reduce menstrual blood loss.NSAIDsmay also make menstrual cramps less painful.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs.NSAIDsNSAIDsTranexamic acid.Tranexamic acid (Lysteda) helps reduce menstrual blood loss.

Elagolix alone (Orilissa) may help control bleeding caused by endometriosis.Other medicines.If you have heavy menstrual bleeding from taking hormone medicine, you may need to stop or change your medicine.If you have anemia due to heavy menstrual bleeding, you may need to take iron supplements. If your iron levels are low but you're not yet anemic, you may be started on iron supplements instead of waiting until you become anemic.ProceduresYou may need surgery for heavy menstrual bleeding if medicines do not help. Treatment options include:Dilation and curettage, also called a D&C.In this procedure, your doctor opens your cervix. This also is called dilating the cervix. The doctor then scrapes or suctions tissue from the lining of your uterus. This also is known as curettage. You may have aD&Cto find the source of abnormal uterine bleeding. Causes of bleeding may include polyps, fibroids or cancer of the uterus. If you've had a miscarriage, you may need aD&Cto completely empty the uterus. Hysteroscopy is often used withD&Cto help doctors find the source of bleeding in the uterus.Uterine artery embolization.The goal of this procedure is to block blood flow to uterine fibroids. Blocking blood flow to fibroids helps to shrink them. During the procedure, the surgeon passes a catheter through the large artery in the thigh. This also is known as the femoral artery. The surgeon guides the catheter to the blood vessels in the uterus and injects tiny beads or sponges to reduce blood flow to the fibroid.Focused ultrasound.This procedure shrinks fibroids by targeting and destroying fibroids through ultrasound waves and radiofrequency energy. It needs no incisions.Myomectomy.This is the surgical removal of uterine fibroids. Depending on the size, number and location of the fibroids, your surgeon may perform the myomectomy through several small incisions in the abdomen. This is known also as the laparoscopic approach. Or the surgeon may put a thin, flexible tube into the vagina and cervix to see and remove fibroids or polyps inside the uterus. This also is called the hysteroscopic approach.Endometrial ablation.This procedure involves destroying the lining of the uterus. The process of destroying tissue also is known as ablation. The surgeon uses a laser, radio waves or heat applied to the lining of the uterus to destroy the tissue.After endometrial ablation, you may have much lighter periods. Pregnancy after endometrial ablation isn't likely but is possible and could be dangerous. Using reliable or permanent birth control until menopause is recommended.Endometrial resection.The surgeon uses an electrosurgical wire loop to remove the lining of the uterus. Pregnancy isn't recommended after this procedure.Hysterectomy.In this procedure, the uterus and cervix are removed. It ends menstrual periods and the ability to get pregnant. Hysterectomy is performed under anesthesia and may require a short hospital stay. Early menopause may occur if the ovaries are removed. The procedure to remove both ovaries is called bilateral oophorectomy.Dilation and curettage, also called a D&C.In this procedure, your doctor opens your cervix. This also is called dilating the cervix. The doctor then scrapes or suctions tissue from the lining of your uterus. This also is known as curettage.

You may need a general anesthetic but it's likely that you can go home on the same day. With an abdominal myomectomy or a hysterectomy, you may need a brief hospital stay.Sometimes heavy menstrual bleeding is a sign of another condition, such as thyroid disease. In those cases, treating the condition usually results in lighter periods.More InformationHeavy periods: Can folic acid help?Ablation therapyDilation and curettage (D&C)Endometrial ablationHormonal IUD (Mirena)Show more related informationMore InformationHeavy periods: Can folic acid help?Ablation therapyDilation and curettage (D&C)Endometrial ablationHormonal IUD (Mirena)Show more related informationHeavy periods: Can folic acid help?Ablation therapyDilation and curettage (D&C)Endometrial ablationHormonal IUD (Mirena)Heavy periods: Can folic acid help?Heavy periods: Can folic acid help?Ablation therapyAblation therapyDilation and curettage (D&C)Dilation and curettage (D&C)Endometrial ablationEndometrial ablationHormonal IUD (Mirena)Hormonal IUD (Mirena)Show more related informationRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

    "674.04: Generalized anxiety disorder": "Treatment decisions are based on how significantly generalized anxiety disorder is affecting your ability to function in your daily life. The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you.PsychotherapyAlso known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective form of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder.Generally a short-term treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on teaching you specific skills to directly manage your worries and help you gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. Through this process, your symptoms improve as you build on your initial success.MedicationsSeveral types of medications are used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects.Antidepressants.Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments. Examples of antidepressants used to treat generalized anxiety disorder include escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva). Your doctor also may recommend other antidepressants.Buspirone.An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be used on an ongoing basis. As with most antidepressants, it typically takes up to several weeks to become fully effective.Benzodiazepines.In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepine for relief of anxiety symptoms. These sedatives are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these medications aren't a good choice if you have or had problems with alcohol or drug abuse.Antidepressants.Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments.

Options include:Internal repair using screws.Metal screws are inserted into the bone to hold it together while the fracture heals. Sometimes screws are attached to a metal plate that runs down the thighbone (femur).Total hip replacement.The upper femur and the socket in the pelvic bone are replaced with artificial parts (prostheses). Increasingly, studies show total hip replacement to be more cost-effective and associated with better long-term outcomes in otherwise healthy adults who live independently.Partial hip replacement.In some situations, the socket part of the hip doesn't need to be replaced.

Increasingly, studies show total hip replacement to be more cost-effective and associated with better long-term outcomes in otherwise healthy adults who live independently.Partial hip replacement.In some situations, the socket part of the hip doesn't need to be replaced. Partial hip replacement might be recommended for adults who have other health conditions or who no longer live independently.SurgeryThe type of surgery generally depends on where and how severe the fracture is, whether the broken bones aren't properly aligned (displaced), and your age and underlying health conditions.

    "756.79: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia": "Treatment of congenital diaphragmatic hernia depends on when the condition is found and how serious it is. Your health care team helps you decide what's best for you and your baby.Care before deliveryYour health care team watches you closely before your baby is born. You typically have ultrasounds and other tests often to check your baby's health and development.An emerging treatment for severeCDHnow being studied is called fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO). This surgery is done on your baby while you're still pregnant. The goal is to help the baby's lungs grow as much as possible before birth.CDHFETOis done in two procedures:FETOFirst procedure.The first procedure happens early in the last few months (third trimester) of your pregnancy. Your surgeon makes a small incision in your abdomen and uterus. The surgeon inserts a special tube with a camera at the end, called a fetal endoscope, through your baby's mouth and into the windpipe (trachea). A small balloon is placed in your baby's trachea and inflated.The natural uterine fluid during pregnancy, called amniotic fluid, flows in and out of your baby's lungs through the mouth. Inflating the balloon keeps amniotic fluid in your baby's lungs. The fluid expands the lungs to help them develop.Second procedure.After about 4 to 6 weeks, you have a second procedure. The balloon is removed so that your baby is ready to take air into the lungs after birth.A special delivery method may be used if labor starts before the balloon has been removed and removal of the balloon with an endoscope is not possible. This method is called an ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure. The delivery is done by C-section with placental support. This means that your baby continues to get oxygen through the placenta before the umbilical cord is cut. Placental support continues until the balloon is out and a breathing tube is in place, allowing a machine to take over breathing.First procedure.The first procedure happens early in the last few months (third trimester) of your pregnancy.

And there's no guarantee about the results of surgery. Your health care team evaluates you and your baby to see whether you may be candidates for this surgery. Talk to your team about the benefits and possible complications for you and your baby.FETOCare during deliveryUsually, you can deliver your baby either vaginally or by C-section. You and your health care provider decide which method is best for you.Care after deliveryAfter birth, the health care team helps you plan treatment that meets your baby's needs. Your baby will likely be cared for in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU).Your baby may need to have a breathing tube. The tube is attached to a machine that helps your baby breathe. This gives the lungs and heart time to grow and develop.Babies who have life-threatening lung problems may need a treatment called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This is also known as extracorporal life support (ECLS). TheECMOmachine does the work of your baby's heart and lungs, allowing these organs to rest and heal.ECMOHow long your baby needs support to breathe depends on the response to treatment and other factors.Most babies who haveCDHhave surgery to close the hole in the diaphragm. When this surgery takes place depends on your baby's health and other factors. Follow-up care to ensure the repair remains in place usually includes chest X-rays.CDHAfter leaving the hospital, your baby may need extra support. This can include supplemental oxygen. Oxygen is delivered by thin plastic tubing with prongs that fit into the nostrils or thin tubing connected to a mask worn over the nose and mouth. Feeding support may also be needed to help with growth and development. Medicine may be given for conditions associated withCDH, such as acid reflux or pulmonary hypertension.CDHRegular follow-up appointments with your child's health care provider can address any problems early.More InformationCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) care at Mayo ClinicExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)Fetal surgeryMore InformationCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) care at Mayo ClinicExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)Fetal surgeryCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) care at Mayo ClinicExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)Fetal surgeryCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) care at Mayo ClinicCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) care at Mayo ClinicExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)Fetal surgeryFetal surgeryRequest an appointmentRequest an appointment",
    "760.75: Preterm birth": "The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or special care nursery closely tracks your premature baby's health.Supportive careThis type of care for your baby may include:Being placed in an incubator.The incubator is an enclosed plastic bassinet that your baby will probably stay in. It's kept warm to help the baby stay at a regular body temperature. Later on,NICUstaff may show you a way to hold your baby with direct skin-to-skin contact. This is known as \"kangaroo care.\"Tracking of your baby's vital signs.Sensors may be taped to your baby's body to track blood pressure, heart rate, breathing and temperature. A machine called a ventilator or a device called CPAP may be used to help your baby breathe.Having a feeding tube.At first your baby may receive fluids and nutrients through a tube in a vein. Breast milk may be given later through a tube passed through your baby's nose and into the baby's stomach. When your baby is strong enough to suck, breastfeeding or bottle-feeding often can be done.Getting enough fluids.Your baby needs a certain amount of fluids each day. The exact amount depends on the baby's age and health. TheNICUteam will closely track fluid, sodium and potassium levels to make sure that your baby's fluid levels stay on target. If fluids are needed, they'll be given through a tube in a vein.Spending time under bilirubin lights.To treat infant jaundice, your baby may be placed under a set of special lights. These lights help your baby's system break down extra bilirubin. That's a yellow-colored substance that builds up in the body if the liver can't process it all. Your baby will wear a protective eye mask while under the lights to rest more easily.Receiving blood from a donor.Some preterm babies need blood transfusions. This can be due to certain health problems, or because many blood samples have been taken for tests.Being placed in an incubator.The incubator is an enclosed plastic bassinet that your baby will probably stay in.

    "770.0: Pneumonia": "Treatment for pneumonia involves curing the infection and preventing complications. People who have community-acquired pneumonia usually can be treated at home with medication. Although most symptoms ease in a few days or weeks, the feeling of tiredness can persist for a month or more.Specific treatments depend on the type and severity of your pneumonia, your age and your overall health. The options include:Antibiotics.These medicines are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. It may take time to identify the type of bacteria causing your pneumonia and to choose the best antibiotic to treat it. If your symptoms don't improve, your doctor may recommend a different antibiotic.Cough medicine.This medicine may be used to calm your cough so that you can rest. Because coughing helps loosen and move fluid from your lungs, it's a good idea not to eliminate your cough completely. In addition, you should know that very few studies have looked at whether over-the-counter cough medicines lessen coughing caused by pneumonia. If you want to try a cough suppressant, use the lowest dose that helps you rest.Fever reducers/pain relievers.You may take these as needed for fever and discomfort. These include drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).Antibiotics.These medicines are used to treat bacterial pneumonia.

    "770.4: Atelectasis": "Treatment of atelectasis depends on the cause. Mild atelectasis may go away without treatment. Sometimes, medicines are used to loosen and thin mucus. If the condition is due to a blockage, you may need surgery or other treatments.Chest physical therapyChest physical therapy, also called chest physiotherapy, is a group of airway clearance techniques. They help you breathe deeply after surgery to expand collapsed lung tissue. It's best to learn these techniques before surgery.These techniques include:Doing deep-breathing exercises using a hand-held device called an incentive spirometer, followed by deep coughing to help clear your lungs. This technique can help get rid of mucus and other secretions. And it can help your lung go back to its larger size.Positioning your body so that your head is lower than your chest. This allows mucus to drain better from the bottom of your lungs.Tapping on your chest over the collapsed area to loosen mucus. This technique is called percussion. You also can use mechanical mucus clearance devices, such as an air pulse vibrator vest or a hand-held instrument.Doing deep-breathing exercises using a hand-held device called an incentive spirometer, followed by deep coughing to help clear your lungs.

During bronchoscopy, the doctor gently guides a flexible tube down your throat to clear your airways.If a tumor is causing atelectasis, treatment may involve removing or shrinking the tumor during the bronchoscopy, which may include surgery. Other cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation, may or may not be needed.Breathing treatmentsIn some cases, a breathing tube may be needed.Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may help some people who are too weak to cough and have low oxygen levels, also called hypoxemia, after surgery.More InformationBronchoscopySpirometryMore InformationBronchoscopySpirometryBronchoscopySpirometryBronchoscopyBronchoscopySpirometrySpirometryRequest an appointmentRequest an appointment",

And diet soft drinks cannot be used to treat an episode of hypoglycemia because they don't have any sugar.Examples of foods that do raise your blood sugar level quickly include:Four glucose tablets (available without a prescription at most pharmacies)A serving of glucose gel (read the label for amount)Five to 6 pieces of hard candy or jelly beans (check the food label for the exact serving)Four ounces (120 milliliters) of fruit juice or regular \u2014 not diet \u2014 sodaOne tablespoon (15 milliliters) of sugar, corn syrup or honeyIn general, food or drink with 15 to 20 grams of carbohydrates is often enough to raise your blood sugar levels back into a safe range.Recheck your blood sugar levelCheck your blood sugar level 15 minutes after eating or drinking something to treat your hypoglycemia. If your blood sugar is still low, eat or drink another 15 to 20 grams of carbohydrates. Repeat this pattern until your blood sugar is above 70mg/dL(3.9mmol/L).Have a snack or mealHave a snack or a meal to keep your blood sugar from dropping again. If you typically take insulin with food, you generally don't need additional insulin if you're eating a snack after having a low blood sugar level. If you're going to eat a meal, however, you may need a reduced dose of insulin to ensure that your blood sugar doesn't rise too quickly.It's important to try not to overtreat your low blood sugar.

It can be lifesaving if someone isn't alert enough to eat or drink something to raise his or her blood sugar. Glucagon is available only by prescription.Glucagon comes in an emergency syringe kit or as a pre-mixed injection that is ready to use. Glucagon is also available as a powdered nasal spray given in one nostril. Store glucagon as directed on the packaging and be aware of the expiration date. When given to someone who is unconscious, the person should be turned on his or her side to prevent choking in case of vomiting.About 15 minutes after getting glucagon, the person should be alert and able to eat. If someone doesn't respond within 15 minutes, call emergency medical care. If someone quickly responds to glucagon, it's still recommended that you contact his or her diabetes health care provider promptly.If you've had a low blood sugar episode that was serious enough to require help from others, your health care provider will likely want to figure out if your insulin or other diabetes medication needs to be adjusted to prevent another serious episode.Emergency treatmentGlucagon is a hormone that raises blood sugar quickly.

    "776.1: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura": "People with mild immune thrombocytopenia might need only regular platelet checks. Children usually improve without treatment. Most adults withITPwill need treatment at some point. The condition often gets worse or lasts long, also known as chronic.ITPTreatment might include medicines to increase platelet count or surgery to remove the spleen, known as a splenectomy. A health care provider can talk about the pros and cons of treatment options. Some people find the side effects of treatment are worse than the disease.MedicationsMake sure your health care provider knows about medicines or supplements you take without a prescription. You might need to stop using any that might increase bleeding. Examples include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and ginkgo biloba.Medicines to treatITPmay include:ITPSteroids.Health care providers often use an oral corticosteroid, such as prednisone. When the platelet count is back to a safe level, the provider can tell how to cut down the medicine a little at a time. Long-term use of these medicines can increase the risk of infections, high blood sugar and osteoporosis.Immune globulin.If corticosteroids don't work, a shot of immune globulin might help. This medicine also treats serious bleeding or quickly increases blood count before surgery. The effect usually wears off in a couple of weeks.Drugs that increase platelets.Medicines such as romiplostim (Nplate), eltrombopag (Promacta) and avatrombopag (Doptelet) help bone marrow make more platelets. These types of medicines can increase the risk of blood clots.Other drugs.Rituximab (Rituxan, Ruxience, Truxima) helps increase the platelet count by reducing the immune system response damaging them. But this medicine also can keep vaccinations from working well. Later surgery to remove the spleen might increase the need for the protection against illness that vaccinations give.Fostamatinib (Tavalisse) is a newer drug approved for people with long-lastingITPwho haven't responded to other treatments.Steroids.Health care providers often use an oral corticosteroid, such as prednisone.

When it works, this surgery quickly ends the attacks on platelets and improves platelet count.ITPBut taking out the spleen doesn't work for everyone. And not having a spleen increases the risk of infection.Emergency treatmentRarely,ITPcan cause a lot of bleeding. Emergency care usually includes getting blood, also known as transfusion, that contains many platelets.

    "778.3: Hypothermia": "Seek immediate medical attention for anyone who appears to have hypothermia. Until medical help is available, follow these first-aid guidelines for hypothermia.First-aid tipsBe gentle.When you're helping a person with hypothermia, handle him or her gently. Limit movements to only those that are necessary. Don't massage or rub the person. Excessive, vigorous or jarring movements may trigger cardiac arrest.Move the person out of the cold.Move the person to a warm, dry location if possible. If you're unable to move the person out of the cold, shield him or her from the cold and wind as much as possible. Keep him or her in a horizontal position if possible.Remove wet clothing.If the person is wearing wet clothing, remove it. Cut away clothing if necessary to avoid excessive movement.Cover the person with blankets.Use layers of dry blankets or coats to warm the person. Cover the person's head, leaving only the face exposed.Insulate the person's body from the cold ground.If you're outside, lay the person on his or her back on a blanket or other warm surface.Monitor breathing.A person with severe hypothermia may appear unconscious, with no apparent signs of a pulse or breathing. If the person's breathing has stopped or appears dangerously low or shallow, begin CPR immediately if you're trained.Provide warm beverages.If the affected person is alert and able to swallow, provide a warm, sweet, nonalcoholic, noncaffeinated beverage to help warm the body.Use warm, dry compresses.Use a first-aid warm compress (a plastic fluid-filled bag that warms up when squeezed) or a makeshift compress of warm water in a plastic bottle or a dryer-warmed towel. Apply a compress only to the neck, chest wall or groin.Don't apply a warm compress to the arms or legs. Heat applied to the arms and legs forces cold blood back toward the heart, lungs and brain, causing the core body temperature to drop. This can be fatal.Don't apply direct heat.Don't use hot water, a heating pad or a heating lamp to warm the person. The extreme heat can damage the skin or, even worse, cause irregular heartbeats so severe that they can cause the heart to stop.Be gentle.When you're helping a person with hypothermia, handle him or her gently.

A common method of warming blood is the use of a hemodialysis machine, which is normally used to filter blood in people with poor kidney function. Heart bypass machines also may need to be used.Warm intravenous fluids.A warmed intravenous solution of salt water may be put into a vein to help warm the blood.Airway rewarming.The use of humidified oxygen administered with a mask or nasal tube can warm the airways and help raise the temperature of the body.Irrigation.A warm saltwater solution may be used to warm certain areas of the body, such as the area around the lungs (pleura) or the abdominal cavity (peritoneal cavity). The warm liquid is introduced into the affected area with catheters.Passive rewarming.For someone with mild hypothermia, it is enough to cover them with heated blankets and offer warm fluids to drink.Passive rewarming.Blood rewarming.Blood may be drawn, warmed and recirculated in the body.

    "779.81: Bradycardia": "Treatment for bradycardia depends on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the slow heart rate. If you don't have symptoms, treatment might not be necessary.Bradycardia treatment may include lifestyle changes, medication changes or an implanted device called a pacemaker. If an underlying health problem, such as thyroid disease or sleep apnea, is causing the slow heart rate, treatment of that condition might correct bradycardia.MedicationsMany medications, including those used to treat other heart conditions, can cause bradycardia. Always let your health care provider know about all the medications you take, including those bought without a prescription.If a medication you're taking is causing bradycardia, your health care provider may recommend a lower dosage or a different medication.Surgery or other proceduresWhen other treatments aren't possible and bradycardia symptoms are severe, a device called a pacemaker is necessary to control the heart rhythm. Pacemakers work only when needed. When the heart beats too slowly, the pacemaker sends electrical signals to the heart to speed up the beat.Having a pacemaker implanted requires a surgical procedure. One or more wires are inserted into a major vein under or near the collarbone and guided to the heart using X-rays as a guide. One end of each wire is secured at the appropriate area in the heart, while the other end is attached to a device (pulse generator) implanted under the skin beneath the collarbone.A leadless pacemaker is smaller and typically requires a less invasive surgery to implant the device.More InformationBradycardia care at Mayo ClinicPacemakerMore InformationBradycardia care at Mayo ClinicPacemakerBradycardia care at Mayo ClinicPacemakerBradycardia care at Mayo ClinicBradycardia care at Mayo ClinicPacemakerPacemakerRequest an appointmentRequest an appointment",

Additional treatments in the emergency room or intensive care unit of a hospital will focus on minimizing secondary damage due to inflammation, bleeding or reduced oxygen supply to the brain.MedicationsMedications to limit secondary damage to the brain immediately after an injury may include:Anti-seizure drugs.People who've had a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury are at risk of having seizures during the first week after their injury.An anti-seizure drug may be given during the first week to avoid any additional brain damage that might be caused by a seizure. Continued anti-seizure treatments are used only if seizures occur.Coma-inducing drugs.Doctors sometimes use drugs to put people into temporary comas because a comatose brain needs less oxygen to function. This is especially helpful if blood vessels, compressed by increased pressure in the brain, are unable to supply brain cells with normal amounts of nutrients and oxygen.Diuretics.These drugs reduce the amount of fluid in tissues and increase urine output. Diuretics, given intravenously to people with traumatic brain injury, help reduce pressure inside the brain.MedicationsMedications to limit secondary damage to the brain immediately after an injury may include:Anti-seizure drugs.People who've had a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury are at risk of having seizures during the first week after their injury.An anti-seizure drug may be given during the first week to avoid any additional brain damage that might be caused by a seizure.

    "997.1: Tachycardia": "The goals of tachycardia treatment are to slow a rapid heartbeat when it occurs and to prevent future episodes of a fast heart rate.If another medical condition is causing tachycardia, treating the underlying problem may reduce or prevent episodes of a fast heartbeat.Slowing a fast heart rateA fast heart rate may correct itself. But sometimes medication or other medical treatments are needed to slow down the heartbeat.Ways to slow a fast heart rate include:Vagal maneuvers.Vagal maneuvers include coughing, bearing down as if having a bowel movement and putting an ice pack on the face. Your health care provider may ask you to perform these specific actions during an episode of a fast heartbeat. These actions affect the vagus nerve, which helps control the heartbeat.Medications.If vagal maneuvers don't stop the fast heartbeat, medication may be needed to restore the heart rhythm.Cardioversion.This medical procedure is usually done by sending electric shocks to the heart through sensors (electrodes) placed on the chest. The shock affects the heart's electrical signals and restores a normal heartbeat. Cardioversion is generally used when emergency care is needed or when vagal maneuvers and medications don't work. It's also possible to do cardioversion with medications.Vagal maneuvers.Vagal maneuvers include coughing, bearing down as if having a bowel movement and putting an ice pack on the face.

It's also possible to do cardioversion with medications.Cardioversion.Preventing future episodes of a fast heart rateThe treatment of tachycardia involves taking steps to prevent the heart from beating too fast. This may involve medication, implanted devices, or other surgeries or procedures.Medications.Drugs to control the heart rate and restore a normal heart rhythm are typically prescribed for most people with tachycardia.Catheter ablation.In this procedure, a health care provider threads one or more thin, flexible tubes (catheters) through an artery, usually in the groin, and guides them to the heart. Sensors (electrodes) on the tip of the catheter use heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in the heart to block irregular electrical signals and restore the heart rhythm. It's often done when an extra signaling pathway is responsible for an increased heart rate.Catheter ablation doesn't require surgery to access the heart, but it may be done at the same time as other heart surgeries.Pacemaker.A pacemaker is a small device that's surgically implanted under the skin in the chest area. When the device senses an irregular heartbeat, it sends an electrical pulse that helps the heart resume the correct rhythm.Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).Your health care provider may recommend this device if you're at high risk of developing ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.AnICDis a battery-powered unit that's implanted under the skin near the collarbone \u2014 similar to a pacemaker. TheICDcontinuously monitors the heart rhythm. If the device detects an irregular heartbeat, it sends out low- or high-energy shocks to reset the heart's rhythm.Maze procedure.In this procedure, a surgeon makes tiny incisions in the upper half of the heart (atria) to create a pattern (or maze) of scar tissue. The heart's signals can't pass through scar tissue. So the maze can block stray electrical heart signals that cause some types of tachycardia.Surgery.Sometimes open-heart surgery may be needed to destroy an extra electrical pathway causing tachycardia. Surgery is usually done only when other treatment options don't work or when surgery is needed to treat another heart disorder.Medications.Drugs to control the heart rate and restore a normal heart rhythm are typically prescribed for most people with tachycardia.Medications.Catheter ablation.In this procedure, a health care provider threads one or more thin, flexible tubes (catheters) through an artery, usually in the groin, and guides them to the heart.

    "V10.3: Cancer": "Treatment options for stomach cancer depend on the cancer's location within the stomach and its stage. Your health care provider also thinks about your overall health and your preferences when making a treatment plan. Stomach cancer treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and palliative care.SurgeryThe goal of surgery for stomach cancer, which is also called gastric cancer, is to remove all of the cancer. For small stomach cancers, surgery might be the first treatment. Other treatments might be used first if the stomach cancer grows deeper into the stomach wall or spreads to the lymph nodes.Operations used to treat stomach cancer include:Removing small cancers from the stomach lining.Very small cancers can be cut away from the inside lining of the stomach. To remove the cancer, a tube is passed down the throat and into the stomach. Special cutting tools are passed through the tube to cut out the cancer. This procedure is called an endoscopic mucosal resection. It might be an option for treating stage 1 cancer that's growing on the inner lining of the stomach.Removing part of the stomach.This procedure is called a subtotal gastrectomy. The surgeon removes the part of the stomach affected by cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it. It might be an option if your stomach cancer is located in the part of the stomach nearest the small intestine.Removing the entire stomach.This procedure is called a total gastrectomy. It involves removing all of the stomach and some surrounding tissue. The surgeon connects the esophagus to the small intestine to allow food to move through the digestive system. Total gastrectomy is a treatment for cancers in the part of the stomach that is closest to the esophagus.Removing lymph nodes to look for cancer.The surgeon may remove lymph nodes in your belly to test them for cancer.Surgery to relieve symptoms.An operation to remove part of the stomach may relieve symptoms of a growing cancer. This might be an option if the cancer is advanced and other treatments haven't helped.Removing small cancers from the stomach lining.Very small cancers can be cut away from the inside lining of the stomach.

This might be an option if the cancer is advanced and other treatments haven't helped.Surgery to relieve symptoms.Small stage 1 stomach cancers often can be cut away from the inner lining of the stomach. But if the cancer grows into the muscle layer of the stomach wall, this might not be an option. Some stage 1 cancers may need surgery to remove all of or some of the stomach.For stage 2 and stage 3 stomach cancers, surgery might not be the first treatment. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy might be used first to shrink the cancer. This might make it easier to remove the cancer completely. Surgery often involves removing some or all of the stomach and also some lymph nodes.If stage 4 stomach cancer grows through the stomach and into nearby organs, surgery might be an option. To remove all of the cancer, parts of the nearby organs might be removed, too. Other treatments might be used first to shrink the cancer. If a stage 4 cancer can't be removed completely, surgery might help control symptoms.ChemotherapyChemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill cancer cells. Types of chemotherapy include:Chemotherapy that travels through your whole body.The most common type of chemotherapy involves medicines that travel through your whole body, killing cancer cells. This is called systemic chemotherapy. The medicines can be given through a vein or taken in pill form.Chemotherapy that only goes in the belly.This type of chemotherapy is called hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).HIPECis done right after surgery. After the surgeon removes the stomach cancer, the chemotherapy medicines are put directly into the belly. The medicines are heated to make them more effective. The chemotherapy is left in place for a set amount of time and then drained.Chemotherapy that travels through your whole body.The most common type of chemotherapy involves medicines that travel through your whole body, killing cancer cells. This is called systemic chemotherapy. The medicines can be given through a vein or taken in pill form.Chemotherapy that travels through your whole body.Chemotherapy that only goes in the belly.This type of chemotherapy is called hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).HIPECis done right after surgery. After the surgeon removes the stomach cancer, the chemotherapy medicines are put directly into the belly. The medicines are heated to make them more effective. The chemotherapy is left in place for a set amount of time and then drained.Chemotherapy that only goes in the belly.HIPECChemotherapy might not be needed for stage 1 stomach cancer. It might not be needed if surgery removed all of the cancer and there's a low risk of cancer coming back.Chemotherapy is often used before surgery to treat stage 2 and stage 3 stomach cancers. Systemic chemotherapy might help shrink the cancer so that it's easier to remove. Giving chemotherapy before surgery is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Systemic chemotherapy might be used after surgery if there's a risk that some cancer cells were left behind. This risk might be higher if the cancer grows deep into the stomach wall or spreads to the lymph nodes. Giving chemotherapy after surgery is called adjuvant chemotherapy.Chemotherapy can be used alone or it can be combined with radiation therapy.If surgery isn't an option, systemic chemotherapy might be recommended instead. It might be used if the cancer is too advanced or if you're not healthy enough to have surgery. Chemotherapy might help control cancer symptoms.HIPECis an experimental treatment that might be an option for stage 4 stomach cancer. It might be used if the cancer can't be removed completely because it extends through the stomach and into nearby organs. The surgeon might remove as much of the cancer as possible. ThenHIPEChelps to kill any cancer cells that are left.HIPECHIPECRadiation therapyRadiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy to kill cancer cells. The beams can come from X-rays, protons or other sources. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine gives the radiation treatment to precise points on your body.Radiation therapy is often done at the same time as chemotherapy. Sometimes doctors call this chemoradiation.Radiation therapy might not be needed for stage 1 stomach cancer. It might not be needed if surgery removed all of the cancer and there's a low risk that the cancer will come back.Radiation is sometimes used before surgery to treat stage 2 and stage 3 stomach cancers. It can shrink the cancer so that it's easier to remove. Giving radiation before surgery is called neoadjuvant radiation.Radiation therapy might be used after surgery if the cancer can't be removed completely. Giving radiation after surgery is called adjuvant radiation.Radiation can help relieve stomach cancer symptoms if the cancer is advanced or surgery isn't possible.Targeted therapyTargeted treatments use medicines that attack specific chemicals present within cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die.Your cancer cells are tested to see if targeted therapy is likely to work for you.For stomach cancer, targeted therapy is often used with systemic chemotherapy. Targeted therapy is typically used for advanced stomach cancer. This might include stage 4 stomach cancer and cancer that comes back after treatment.ImmunotherapyImmunotherapy is a treatment with medicine that helps your body's immune system to kill cancer cells. Your immune system fights off diseases by attacking germs and other cells that shouldn't be in your body. Cancer cells survive by hiding from the immune system. Immunotherapy helps the immune system cells find and kill the cancer cells.Immunotherapy is sometimes used to treat advanced cancer. This might include stage 4 stomach cancer or cancer that comes back after treatment.Palliative carePalliative care is a special type of health care that helps you feel better when you have a serious illness. If you have cancer, palliative care can help relieve pain and other symptoms. Palliative care is done by a team of health care providers. This can include doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Their goal is to improve the quality of life for you and your family.Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your care team to help you feel better. They provide an extra layer of support while you have cancer treatment. You can have palliative care at the same time as strong cancer treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer.More InformationStomach cancer care at Mayo ClinicChemotherapyPalliative careRadiation therapyStomach cancer FAQsShow more related informationMore InformationStomach cancer care at Mayo ClinicChemotherapyPalliative careRadiation therapyStomach cancer FAQsShow more related informationStomach cancer care at Mayo ClinicChemotherapyPalliative careRadiation therapyStomach cancer FAQsStomach cancer care at Mayo ClinicStomach cancer care at Mayo ClinicChemotherapyChemotherapyPalliative carePalliative careRadiation therapyRadiation therapyStomach cancer FAQsStomach cancer FAQsShow more related informationRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

    "V10.46: Cancer": "Treatment options for stomach cancer depend on the cancer's location within the stomach and its stage. Your health care provider also thinks about your overall health and your preferences when making a treatment plan. Stomach cancer treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and palliative care.SurgeryThe goal of surgery for stomach cancer, which is also called gastric cancer, is to remove all of the cancer. For small stomach cancers, surgery might be the first treatment. Other treatments might be used first if the stomach cancer grows deeper into the stomach wall or spreads to the lymph nodes.Operations used to treat stomach cancer include:Removing small cancers from the stomach lining.Very small cancers can be cut away from the inside lining of the stomach. To remove the cancer, a tube is passed down the throat and into the stomach. Special cutting tools are passed through the tube to cut out the cancer. This procedure is called an endoscopic mucosal resection. It might be an option for treating stage 1 cancer that's growing on the inner lining of the stomach.Removing part of the stomach.This procedure is called a subtotal gastrectomy. The surgeon removes the part of the stomach affected by cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it. It might be an option if your stomach cancer is located in the part of the stomach nearest the small intestine.Removing the entire stomach.This procedure is called a total gastrectomy. It involves removing all of the stomach and some surrounding tissue. The surgeon connects the esophagus to the small intestine to allow food to move through the digestive system. Total gastrectomy is a treatment for cancers in the part of the stomach that is closest to the esophagus.Removing lymph nodes to look for cancer.The surgeon may remove lymph nodes in your belly to test them for cancer.Surgery to relieve symptoms.An operation to remove part of the stomach may relieve symptoms of a growing cancer. This might be an option if the cancer is advanced and other treatments haven't helped.Removing small cancers from the stomach lining.Very small cancers can be cut away from the inside lining of the stomach.

This might be an option if the cancer is advanced and other treatments haven't helped.Surgery to relieve symptoms.Small stage 1 stomach cancers often can be cut away from the inner lining of the stomach. But if the cancer grows into the muscle layer of the stomach wall, this might not be an option. Some stage 1 cancers may need surgery to remove all of or some of the stomach.For stage 2 and stage 3 stomach cancers, surgery might not be the first treatment. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy might be used first to shrink the cancer. This might make it easier to remove the cancer completely. Surgery often involves removing some or all of the stomach and also some lymph nodes.If stage 4 stomach cancer grows through the stomach and into nearby organs, surgery might be an option. To remove all of the cancer, parts of the nearby organs might be removed, too. Other treatments might be used first to shrink the cancer. If a stage 4 cancer can't be removed completely, surgery might help control symptoms.ChemotherapyChemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill cancer cells. Types of chemotherapy include:Chemotherapy that travels through your whole body.The most common type of chemotherapy involves medicines that travel through your whole body, killing cancer cells. This is called systemic chemotherapy. The medicines can be given through a vein or taken in pill form.Chemotherapy that only goes in the belly.This type of chemotherapy is called hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).HIPECis done right after surgery. After the surgeon removes the stomach cancer, the chemotherapy medicines are put directly into the belly. The medicines are heated to make them more effective. The chemotherapy is left in place for a set amount of time and then drained.Chemotherapy that travels through your whole body.The most common type of chemotherapy involves medicines that travel through your whole body, killing cancer cells.

It might not be needed if surgery removed all of the cancer and there's a low risk of cancer coming back.Chemotherapy is often used before surgery to treat stage 2 and stage 3 stomach cancers. Systemic chemotherapy might help shrink the cancer so that it's easier to remove. Giving chemotherapy before surgery is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Systemic chemotherapy might be used after surgery if there's a risk that some cancer cells were left behind. This risk might be higher if the cancer grows deep into the stomach wall or spreads to the lymph nodes. Giving chemotherapy after surgery is called adjuvant chemotherapy.Chemotherapy can be used alone or it can be combined with radiation therapy.If surgery isn't an option, systemic chemotherapy might be recommended instead. It might be used if the cancer is too advanced or if you're not healthy enough to have surgery. Chemotherapy might help control cancer symptoms.HIPECis an experimental treatment that might be an option for stage 4 stomach cancer. It might be used if the cancer can't be removed completely because it extends through the stomach and into nearby organs. The surgeon might remove as much of the cancer as possible. ThenHIPEChelps to kill any cancer cells that are left.HIPECHIPECRadiation therapyRadiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy to kill cancer cells. The beams can come from X-rays, protons or other sources. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine gives the radiation treatment to precise points on your body.Radiation therapy is often done at the same time as chemotherapy. Sometimes doctors call this chemoradiation.Radiation therapy might not be needed for stage 1 stomach cancer. It might not be needed if surgery removed all of the cancer and there's a low risk that the cancer will come back.Radiation is sometimes used before surgery to treat stage 2 and stage 3 stomach cancers. It can shrink the cancer so that it's easier to remove. Giving radiation before surgery is called neoadjuvant radiation.Radiation therapy might be used after surgery if the cancer can't be removed completely. Giving radiation after surgery is called adjuvant radiation.Radiation can help relieve stomach cancer symptoms if the cancer is advanced or surgery isn't possible.Targeted therapyTargeted treatments use medicines that attack specific chemicals present within cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die.Your cancer cells are tested to see if targeted therapy is likely to work for you.For stomach cancer, targeted therapy is often used with systemic chemotherapy. Targeted therapy is typically used for advanced stomach cancer. This might include stage 4 stomach cancer and cancer that comes back after treatment.ImmunotherapyImmunotherapy is a treatment with medicine that helps your body's immune system to kill cancer cells. Your immune system fights off diseases by attacking germs and other cells that shouldn't be in your body. Cancer cells survive by hiding from the immune system. Immunotherapy helps the immune system cells find and kill the cancer cells.Immunotherapy is sometimes used to treat advanced cancer. This might include stage 4 stomach cancer or cancer that comes back after treatment.Palliative carePalliative care is a special type of health care that helps you feel better when you have a serious illness. If you have cancer, palliative care can help relieve pain and other symptoms. Palliative care is done by a team of health care providers. This can include doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Their goal is to improve the quality of life for you and your family.Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your care team to help you feel better. They provide an extra layer of support while you have cancer treatment. You can have palliative care at the same time as strong cancer treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer.More InformationStomach cancer care at Mayo ClinicChemotherapyPalliative careRadiation therapyStomach cancer FAQsShow more related informationMore InformationStomach cancer care at Mayo ClinicChemotherapyPalliative careRadiation therapyStomach cancer FAQsShow more related informationStomach cancer care at Mayo ClinicChemotherapyPalliative careRadiation therapyStomach cancer FAQsStomach cancer care at Mayo ClinicStomach cancer care at Mayo ClinicChemotherapyChemotherapyPalliative carePalliative careRadiation therapyRadiation therapyStomach cancer FAQsStomach cancer FAQsShow more related informationRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

If so, you may need treatment with antibiotics for these accompanying bacterial infections.Severe narrowing of your airway may be treated with corticosteroids.Risk of rash with some medications.Amoxicillin and other antibiotics, including those made from penicillin, aren't recommended for people with mononucleosis. In fact, some people with mononucleosis who take one of these drugs may develop a rash. The rash doesn't necessarily mean that they're allergic to the antibiotic, however. If needed, other antibiotics that are less likely to cause a rash are available to treat infections that may go along with mononucleosis.MedicationsTreating secondary infections and other complications.A streptococcal (strep) infection sometimes goes along with the sore throat of mononucleosis.

    "V29.3: Metabolic dysfunction\u2013associated steatotic liver disease": "Keep in mind that sexual dysfunction is a problem only if it bothers you. If it doesn't bother you, there's no need for treatment.Because female sexual dysfunction has many possible symptoms and causes, treatment varies. It's important for you to communicate your concerns, as well as to understand your body and its normal sexual response. Also, your goals for your sex life are important for choosing a treatment and evaluating whether or not it's working for you.Women with sexual concerns most often benefit from a combined treatment approach that addresses medical as well as relationship and emotional issues.Nonmedical treatment for female sexual dysfunctionTo treat sexual dysfunction, your doctor might recommend that you start with these strategies:Talk and listen.Open communication with your partner makes a world of difference in your sexual satisfaction. Even if you're not used to talking about your likes and dislikes, learning to do so and providing feedback in a nonthreatening way sets the stage for greater intimacy.Practice healthy lifestyle habits.Limit alcohol \u2014 drinking too much can blunt your sexual responsiveness. Be physically active \u2014 regular physical activity can increase your stamina and elevate your mood, enhancing romantic feelings. Learn ways to decrease stress so you can focus on and enjoy sexual experiences.Seek counseling.Talk with a counselor or therapist who specializes in sexual and relationship problems. Therapy often includes education about how to optimize your body's sexual response, ways to enhance intimacy with your partner, and recommendations for reading materials or couples exercises.Use a lubricant.A vaginal lubricant may be helpful during intercourse if you have vaginal dryness or pain during sex.Try a device.Arousal may be enhanced with stimulation of the clitoris. Use a vibrator to provide clitoral stimulation.Talk and listen.Open communication with your partner makes a world of difference in your sexual satisfaction.

Use a vibrator to provide clitoral stimulation.Try a device.Medical treatment for female sexual dysfunctionEffective treatment for sexual dysfunction often requires addressing an underlying medical condition or hormonal change. Your doctor may suggest changing a medication you're taking or prescribing a new one.Possible treatments for female sexual dysfunction might include:Estrogen therapy.Localized estrogen therapy comes in the form of a vaginal ring, cream or tablet. This therapy benefits sexual function by improving vaginal tone and elasticity, increasing vaginal blood flow and enhancing lubrication.The risks of hormone therapy may vary depending on your age, your risk of other health issues such as heart and blood vessel disease and cancer, the dose and type of hormone and whether estrogen is given alone or with a progestin.Talk with your doctor about benefits and risks. In some cases, hormonal therapy might require close monitoring by your doctor.Ospemifene (Osphena).This medication is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. It helps reduce pain during sex for women with vulvovaginal atrophy.Androgen therapy.Androgens include testosterone. Testosterone plays a role in healthy sexual function in women as well as men, although women have much lower levels of testosterone.Androgen therapy for sexual dysfunction is controversial. Some studies show a benefit for women who have low testosterone levels and develop sexual dysfunction; other studies show little or no benefit.Flibanserin (Addyi).Originally developed as an antidepressant, flibanserin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for low sexual desire in premenopausal women.A daily pill, Addyi may boost sex drive in women who experience low sexual desire and find it distressing. Potentially serious side effects include low blood pressure, sleepiness, nausea, fatigue, dizziness and fainting, particularly if the drug is mixed with alcohol. Experts recommend that you stop taking the drug if you don't notice an improvement in your sex drive after eight weeks.Bremelanotide (Vyleesi).Bremelanotide is anotherFDA-approved treatment for low sexual desire in premenopausal women. This medication is an injection you give yourself just under the skin in the belly or thigh before anticipated sexual activity.Some women experience nausea, which is more common after the first injection but tends to improve with the second injection. Other side effects include vomiting, flushing, headache and a skin reaction at the site of the injection.Estrogen therapy.Localized estrogen therapy comes in the form of a vaginal ring, cream or tablet.

Due to concerns over increased risk of breast cancer and stroke in women taking tibolone, the drug isn't approved by theFDAfor use in the U.S.Phosphodiesterase inhibitors.This group of medications has proved successful in treating erectile dysfunction in men, but the drugs don't work nearly as well in treating female sexual dysfunction. Studies looking into the effectiveness of these drugs in women show inconsistent results.One drug, sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra), may prove beneficial for some women who have sexual dysfunction as a result of taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a class of drugs used to treat depression. Don't take sildenafil if you use nitroglycerin for angina \u2014 a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart.Tibolone.Tibolone is a synthetic steroid drug used in Europe and Australia for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

    "V45.72: Fistula": "If an arteriovenous fistula is small and doesn't cause any other health problems, close monitoring by a health care provider may be the only treatment needed. Some small arteriovenous fistulas close by themselves without treatment.If an arteriovenous fistula requires treatment, your provider may recommend:Ultrasound-guided compression.This may be an option for an arteriovenous fistula in the legs that's easily seen on ultrasound. In this treatment, an ultrasound probe is push down on the fistula for about 10 minutes. The compression destroys blood flow to the damaged blood vessels.Catheter embolization.In this procedure, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted in an artery near the arteriovenous fistula. Then, a small coil or stent is placed at the site of the fistula to reroute blood flow. Many people who have catheter embolization stay in the hospital for less than a day and can resume daily activities within a week.Surgery.Large arteriovenous fistulas that can't be treated with catheter embolization may require surgery.

    "V45.76: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease": "Many people withCOPDhave mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than smoking cessation. Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, slow progression, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life.COPDQuitting smokingThe most essential step in any treatment plan forCOPDis to quit all smoking. Stopping smoking can keepCOPDfrom getting worse and reducing your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn't easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you've tried to quit and have been unsuccessful.COPDCOPDTalk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. Also, avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible.MedicationsSeveral kinds of medications are used to treat the symptoms and complications ofCOPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.COPDBronchodilatorsBronchodilators are medications that usually come in inhalers \u2014 they relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both.Examples of short-acting bronchodilators include:Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA)Levalbuterol (Xopenex)Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA)Levalbuterol (Xopenex)Examples of long-acting bronchodilators include:Aclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)Arformoterol (Brovana)Formoterol (Perforomist)Indacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)Tiotropium (Spiriva)Salmeterol (Serevent)Umeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)Aclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)Arformoterol (Brovana)Formoterol (Perforomist)Indacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)Tiotropium (Spiriva)Salmeterol (Serevent)Umeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)Inhaled steroidsInhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations ofCOPD. Examples of inhaled steroids include:COPDFluticasone (Flovent HFA)Budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)Fluticasone (Flovent HFA)Budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)Combination inhalersSome medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Examples of these combination inhalers include:Fluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)Fluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)Formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)Fluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)Fluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)Formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)Combination inhalers that include more than one type of bronchodilator also are available. Examples of these include:Aclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)Albuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)Formoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)Glycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)Olodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)Umeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)Aclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)Albuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)Formoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)Glycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)Olodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)Umeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)Oral steroidsFor people who experience periods when theirCOPDbecomes more severe, called moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids may prevent further worsening ofCOPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection.COPDCOPDPhosphodiesterase-4 inhibitorsA medication approved for people with severeCOPDand symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss.COPDTheophyllineWhen other treatment has been ineffective or if cost is a factor, theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Theochron), a less expensive medication, may help improve breathing and prevent episodes of worseningCOPD. Side effects are dose related and may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor, so tests are used to monitor blood levels of the medication.COPDAntibioticsRespiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravateCOPDsymptoms. Antibiotics help treat episodes of worseningCOPD, but they aren't generally recommended for prevention. Some studies show that certain antibiotics, such as azithromycin (Zithromax), prevent episodes of worseningCOPD, but side effects and antibiotic resistance may limit their use.COPDCOPDCOPDLung therapiesDoctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severeCOPD:COPDOxygen therapy.If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices that deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town.Some people withCOPDuse oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the onlyCOPDtherapy proved to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options.Pulmonary rehabilitation program.These programs generally combine education, exercise training, nutrition advice and counseling. You'll work with a variety of specialists, who can tailor your rehabilitation program to meet your needs.Pulmonary rehabilitation after episodes of worseningCOPDmay reduce readmission to the hospital, increase your ability to participate in everyday activities and improve your quality of life. Talk to your doctor about referral to a program.Oxygen therapy.If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen.

Talk to your doctor about referral to a program.COPDIn-home noninvasive ventilation therapyEvidence supports in-hospital use of breathing devices such as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), but some research now supports the benefit of its use at home. A noninvasive ventilation therapy machine with a mask helps to improve breathing and decrease retention of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) that may lead to acute respiratory failure and hospitalization. More research is needed to determine the best ways to use this therapy.Managing exacerbationsEven with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don't receive prompt treatment.Exacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other triggers of inflammation. Whatever the cause, it's important to seek prompt medical help if you notice a sustained increase in coughing or a change in your mucus, or if you have a harder time breathing.When exacerbations occur, you may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, your doctor can talk with you about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking; taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications; getting your annual flu vaccine; and avoiding air pollution whenever possible.SurgerySurgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren't helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include:Lung volume reduction surgery.In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival.Endoscopic lung volume reduction \u2014 a minimally invasive procedure \u2014 has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat people withCOPD. A tiny one-way endobronchial valve is placed in the lung, allowing the most damaged lobe to shrink so that the healthier part of the lung has more space to expand and function.Lung transplant.Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it's a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and you'll need to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications.Bullectomy.Large air spaces (bullae) form in the lungs when the walls of the air sacs (alveoli) are destroyed. These bullae can become very large and cause breathing problems. In a bullectomy, doctors remove bullae from the lungs to help improve air flow.Lung volume reduction surgery.In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs.

    "V58.67: Diabetes": "Depending on what type of diabetes you have, blood sugar monitoring, insulin and oral drugs may be part of your treatment. Eating a healthy diet, staying at a healthy weight and getting regular physical activity also are important parts of managing diabetes.Treatments for all types of diabetesAn important part of managing diabetes \u2014 as well as your overall health \u2014 is keeping a healthy weight through a healthy diet and exercise plan:Healthy eating.Yourdiabetes dietis simply a healthy-eating plan that will help you control your blood sugar. You'll need to focus your diet on more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains. These are foods that are high in nutrition and fiber and low in fat and calories. You'll also cut down on saturated fats, refined carbohydrates and sweets. In fact, it's the best eating plan for the entire family. Sugary foods are OK once in a while. They must be counted as part of your meal plan.Understanding what and how much to eat can be a challenge. A registered dietitian can help you create a meal plan that fits your health goals, food preferences and lifestyle. This will likely include carbohydrate counting, especially if you have type 1 diabetes or use insulin as part of your treatment.Physical activity.Everyone needs regular aerobic activity. This includes people who have diabetes. Physical activity lowers your blood sugar level by moving sugar into your cells, where it's used for energy. Physical activity also makes your body more sensitive to insulin. That means your body needs less insulin to transport sugar to your cells.Get your provider's OK to exercise. Then choose activities you enjoy, such as walking, swimming or biking. What's most important is making physical activity part of your daily routine.Aim for at least 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. Bouts of activity can be a few minutes during the day. If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly and build up slowly. Also avoid sitting for too long. Try to get up and move if you've been sitting for more than 30 minutes.Healthy eating.Yourdiabetes dietis simply a healthy-eating plan that will help you control your blood sugar.

For some people with type 1 diabetes, pancreas transplant or islet cell transplant may be an option.Treatment for type 1 diabetesTreatment of type 2 diabetesmostly involves lifestyle changes, monitoring of your blood sugar, along with oral diabetes drugs, insulin or both.Treatment of type 2 diabetesMonitoring your blood sugarDepending on your treatment plan, you may check and record your blood sugar as many as four times a day or more often if you're taking insulin. Carefulblood sugar testingis the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level remains within your target range. People with type 2 diabetes who aren't taking insulin generally check their blood sugar much less often.blood sugar testingPeople who receive insulin therapy also may choose to monitor their blood sugar levels with a continuous glucose monitor. Although this technology hasn't yet completely replaced theglucose meter, it can lower the number of fingersticks necessary to check blood sugar and provide important information about trends in blood sugar levels.glucose meterEven with careful management, blood sugar levels can sometimes change unpredictably. With help from your diabetes treatment team, you'll learn how your blood sugar level changes in response to food, physical activity, medications, illness, alcohol and stress. For women, you'll learn how your blood sugar level changes in response to changes in hormone levels.Besides daily blood sugar monitoring, your provider will likely recommend regular A1C testing to measure your average blood sugar level for the past 2 to 3 months.Compared with repeated daily blood sugar tests, A1C testing shows better how well your diabetes treatment plan is working overall. A higher A1C level may signal the need for a change in your oral drugs, insulin regimen or meal plan.Your target A1C goal may vary depending on your age and various other factors, such as other medical conditions you may have or your ability to feel when your blood sugar is low. However, for most people with diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C of below 7%. Ask your provider what your A1C target is.InsulinPeople with type 1 diabetes mustuse insulin to manage blood sugarto survive. Many people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes also need insulin therapy.use insulin to manage blood sugarMany types of insulin are available, including short-acting (regular insulin), rapid-acting insulin, long-acting insulin and intermediate options. Depending on your needs, your provider may prescribe a mixture of insulin types to use during the day and night.Insulin can't be taken orally to lower blood sugar because stomach enzymes interfere with insulin's action. Insulin is often injected using a fine needle and syringe or an insulin pen \u2014 a device that looks like a large ink pen.An insulin pump also may be an option. The pump is a device about the size of a small cellphone worn on the outside of your body. A tube connects the reservoir of insulin to a tube (catheter) that's inserted under the skin of your abdomen.Enlarge imageCloseContinuous glucose monitor and insulin pumpContinuous glucose monitor and insulin pumpA continuous glucose monitor, on the left, is a device that measures blood sugar every few minutes using a sensor inserted under the skin.

Insulin pumps are programmed to deliver specific amounts of insulin continuously and with food.A tubeless pump that works wirelessly is also now available. You program an insulin pump to dispense specific amounts of insulin. It can be adjusted to give out more or less insulin depending on meals, activity level and blood sugar level.A closed loop system is a device implanted in the body that links a continuous glucose monitor to an insulin pump. The monitor checks blood sugar levels regularly. The device automatically delivers the right amount of insulin when the monitor shows that it's needed.The Food and Drug Administration has approved several hybrid closed loop systems for type 1 diabetes. They are called \"hybrid\" because these systems require some input from the user. For example, you may have to tell the device how many carbohydrates are eaten, or confirm blood sugar levels from time to time.A closed loop system that doesn't need any user input isn't available yet. But more of these systems currently are in clinical trials.Oral or other drugsSometimes your provider may prescribe other oral or injected drugs as well. Some diabetes drugs help your pancreas to release more insulin. Others prevent the production and release of glucose from your liver, which means you need less insulin to move sugar into your cells.Still others block the action of stomach or intestinal enzymes that break down carbohydrates, slowing their absorption, or make your tissues more sensitive to insulin. Metformin (Glumetza, Fortamet, others) is generally the first drug prescribed for type 2 diabetes.Another class of medication called SGLT2 inhibitors may be used. They work by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing filtered sugar into the blood. Instead, the sugar is eliminated in the urine.TransplantationIn some people who have type 1 diabetes, apancreas transplantmay be an option. Islet transplants are being studied as well. With a successful pancreas transplant, you would no longer need insulin therapy.pancreas transplantBut transplants aren't always successful. And these procedures pose serious risks. You need a lifetime of immune-suppressing drugs to prevent organ rejection. These drugs can have serious side effects. Because of this, transplants are usually reserved for people whose diabetes can't be controlled or those who also need a kidney transplant.Bariatric surgerySome people with type 2 diabetes who are obese and have a body mass index higher than 35 may be helped by sometypes of bariatric surgery. People who've had gastric bypass have seen major improvements in their blood sugar levels. But this procedure's long-term risks and benefits for type 2 diabetes aren't yet known.types of bariatric surgeryTreatment for gestational diabetesControlling your blood sugar level is essential to keeping your baby healthy. It can also keep you from having complications during delivery. In addition to having a healthy diet and exercising regularly, yourtreatment plan for gestational diabetesmay include monitoring your blood sugar. In some cases, you may also use insulin or oral drugs.treatment plan for gestational diabetesYour provider will monitor your blood sugar level during labor. If your blood sugar rises, your baby may release high levels of insulin. This can lead to low blood sugar right after birth.Treatment for prediabetesTreatment for prediabetesusually involves healthy lifestyle choices. These habits can help bring your blood sugar level back to normal. Or it could keep it from rising toward the levels seen in type 2 diabetes. Keeping a healthy weight through exercise and healthy eating can help. Exercising at least 150 minutes a week and losing about 7% of your body weight may prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.Treatment for prediabetesDrugs \u2014 such as metformin, statins and high blood pressure medications \u2014 may be an option for some people with prediabetes and other conditions such as heart disease.Signs of trouble in any type of diabetesMany factors can affect your blood sugar. Problems may sometimes come up that need care right away.High blood sugarHigh blood sugar (hyperglycemia in diabetes) can occur for many reasons, including eating too much, being sick or not taking enough glucose-lowering medication. Check your blood sugar level as directed by your provider. And watch for symptoms of high blood sugar, including:hyperglycemia in diabetesUrinating oftenFeeling thirstier than usualBlurred visionTiredness (fatigue)HeadacheIrritabilityUrinating oftenFeeling thirstier than usualBlurred visionTiredness (fatigue)HeadacheIrritabilityIf you have hyperglycemia, you'll need to adjust your meal plan, drugs or both.Increased ketones in your urineDiabetic ketoacidosisis a serious complication of diabetes. If your cells are starved for energy, your body may begin to break down fat. This makes toxic acids known as ketones, which can build up in the blood. Watch for the following symptoms:Diabetic ketoacidosisNauseaVomitingStomach (abdominal) painA sweet, fruity smell on your breathShortness of breathDry mouthWeaknessConfusionComaNauseaVomitingStomach (abdominal) painA sweet, fruity smell on your breathShortness of breathDry mouthWeaknessConfusionComaYou can check your urine for excess ketones with a ketones test kit that you can get without a prescription. If you have excess ketones in your urine, talk with your provider right away or seek emergency care. This condition is more common in people with type 1 diabetes.Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndromeHyperosmolar syndrome is caused by very high blood sugar that turns blood thick and syrupy.Symptoms of this life-threatening condition include:A blood sugar reading over 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L)Dry mouthExtreme thirstFeverDrowsinessConfusionVision lossHallucinationsA blood sugar reading over 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L)Dry mouthExtreme thirstFeverDrowsinessConfusionVision lossHallucinationsThis condition is seen in people with type 2 diabetes. It often happens after an illness. Call your provider or seek medical care right away if you have symptoms of this condition.Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)If your blood sugar level drops below your target range, it's known as low blood sugar (diabetic hypoglycemia). If you're taking drugs that lower your blood sugar, including insulin, your blood sugar level can drop for many reasons. These include skipping a meal and getting more physical activity than normal. Low blood sugar also occurs if you take too much insulin or too much of a glucose-lowering medication that causes the pancreas to hold insulin.diabetic hypoglycemiaCheck your blood sugar level regularly and watch for symptoms of low blood sugar, including:SweatingShakinessWeaknessHungerDizzinessHeadacheBlurred visionHeart palpitationsIrritabilitySlurred speechDrowsinessConfusionFaintingSeizuresSweatingShakinessWeaknessHungerDizzinessHeadacheBlurred visionHeart palpitationsIrritabilitySlurred speechDrowsinessConfusionFaintingSeizuresLow blood sugar is best treated with carbohydrates that your body can absorb quickly, such as fruit juice or glucose tablets.Request an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

And they may help to delay or prevent complications.Healthy eatingThere's no specific diabetes diet. However, it's important to center your diet around:A regular schedule for meals and healthy snacks.Smaller portion sizes.More high-fiber foods, such as fruits, nonstarchy vegetables and whole grains.Fewer refined grains, starchy vegetables and sweets.Modest servings of low-fat dairy, low-fat meats and fish.Healthy cooking oils, such as olive oil or canola oil.Fewer calories.A regular schedule for meals and healthy snacks.Smaller portion sizes.More high-fiber foods, such as fruits, nonstarchy vegetables and whole grains.Fewer refined grains, starchy vegetables and sweets.Modest servings of low-fat dairy, low-fat meats and fish.Healthy cooking oils, such as olive oil or canola oil.Fewer calories.Your health care provider may recommend seeing a registered dietitian, who can help you:Identify healthy food choices.Plan well-balanced, nutritional meals.Develop new habits and address barriers to changing habits.Monitor carbohydrate intake to keep your blood sugar levels more stable.Identify healthy food choices.Plan well-balanced, nutritional meals.Develop new habits and address barriers to changing habits.Monitor carbohydrate intake to keep your blood sugar levels more stable.Physical activityExercise is important for losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight. It also helps with managing blood sugar. Talk to your health care provider before starting or changing your exercise program to ensure that activities are safe for you.Aerobic exercise.Choose an aerobic exercise that you enjoy, such as walking, swimming, biking or running. Adults should aim for 30 minutes or more of moderate aerobic exercise on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes a week.Resistance exercise.Resistance exercise increases your strength, balance and ability to perform activities of daily living more easily. Resistance training includes weightlifting, yoga and calisthenics. Adults living with type 2 diabetes should aim for 2 to 3 sessions of resistance exercise each week.Limit inactivity.Breaking up long periods of inactivity, such as sitting at the computer, can help control blood sugar levels. Take a few minutes to stand, walk around or do some light activity every 30 minutes.Aerobic exercise.Choose an aerobic exercise that you enjoy, such as walking, swimming, biking or running.

Take a few minutes to stand, walk around or do some light activity every 30 minutes.Limit inactivity.Weight lossWeight loss results in better control of blood sugar levels, cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure. If you're overweight, you may begin to see improvements in these factors after losing as little as 5% of your body weight. However, the more weight you lose, the greater the benefit to your health. In some cases, losing up to 15% of body weight may be recommended.Your health care provider or dietitian can help you set appropriate weight-loss goals and encourage lifestyle changes to help you achieve them.Monitoring your blood sugarYour health care provider will advise you on how often to check your blood sugar level to make sure you remain within your target range. You may, for example, need to check it once a day and before or after exercise. If you take insulin, you may need to check your blood sugar multiple times a day.Monitoring is usually done with a small, at-home device called a blood glucose meter, which measures the amount of sugar in a drop of blood. Keep a record of your measurements to share with your health care team.Continuous glucose monitoring is an electronic system that records glucose levels every few minutes from a sensor placed under the skin. Information can be transmitted to a mobile device such as a phone, and the system can send alerts when levels are too high or too low.Diabetes medicationsIf you can't maintain your target blood sugar level with diet and exercise, your health care provider may prescribe diabetes medications that help lower glucose levels, or your provider may suggest insulin therapy. Medicines for type 2 diabetes include the following.Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, others)is generally the first medicine prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It works mainly by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin so it uses insulin more effectively.Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, others)Some people experience B-12 deficiency and may need to take supplements. Other possible side effects, which may improve over time, include:Nausea.Abdominal pain.Bloating.Diarrhea.Nausea.Abdominal pain.Bloating.Diarrhea.Sulfonylureashelp the body secrete more insulin. Examples include glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase), glipizide (Glucotrol XL) and glimepiride (Amaryl). Possible side effects include:SulfonylureasLow blood sugar.Weight gain.Low blood sugar.Weight gain.Glinidesstimulate the pancreas to secrete more insulin. They're faster acting than sulfonylureas. But their effect in the body is shorter. Examples include repaglinide and nateglinide. Possible side effects include:GlinidesLow blood sugar.Weight gain.Low blood sugar.Weight gain.Thiazolidinedionesmake the body's tissues more sensitive to insulin. An example of this medicine is pioglitazone (Actos). Possible side effects include:ThiazolidinedionesRisk of congestive heart failure.Risk of bladder cancer (pioglitazone).Risk of bone fractures.Weight gain.Risk of congestive heart failure.Risk of bladder cancer (pioglitazone).Risk of bone fractures.Weight gain.DPP-4 inhibitorshelp reduce blood sugar levels but tend to have a very modest effect. Examples include sitagliptin (Januvia), saxagliptin (Onglyza) and linagliptin (Tradjenta). Possible side effects include:DPP-4 inhibitorsRisk of pancreatitis.Joint pain.Risk of pancreatitis.Joint pain.GLP-1 receptor agonistsare injectable medications that slow digestion and help lower blood sugar levels. Their use is often associated with weight loss, and some may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. Examples include exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon Bcise), liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza) and semaglutide (Rybelsus, Ozempic, Wegovy). Possible side effects include:GLP-1 receptor agonistsRisk of pancreatitis.Nausea.Vomiting.Diarrhea.Risk of pancreatitis.Nausea.Vomiting.Diarrhea.SGLT2 inhibitorsaffect the blood-filtering functions in the kidneys by blocking the return of glucose to the bloodstream. As a result, glucose is removed in the urine. These medicines may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with a high risk of those conditions. Examples include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga) and empagliflozin (Jardiance). Possible side effects include:SGLT2 inhibitorsVaginal yeast infections.Urinary tract infections.Low blood pressure.High cholesterol.Risk of gangrene.Risk of bone fractures (canagliflozin).Risk of amputation (canagliflozin).Vaginal yeast infections.Urinary tract infections.Low blood pressure.High cholesterol.Risk of gangrene.Risk of bone fractures (canagliflozin).Risk of amputation (canagliflozin).Other medicinesyour health care provider might prescribe in addition to diabetes medications include blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering medicines, as well as low-dose aspirin, to help prevent heart and blood vessel disease.Other medicinesInsulin therapySome people who have type 2 diabetes need insulin therapy. In the past, insulin therapy was used as a last resort, but today it may be prescribed sooner if blood sugar targets aren't met with lifestyle changes and other medicines.Different types of insulin vary on how quickly they begin to work and how long they have an effect. Long-acting insulin, for example, is designed to work overnight or throughout the day to keep blood sugar levels stable. Short-acting insulin generally is used at mealtime.Your health care provider will determine what type of insulin is right for you and when you should take it. Your insulin type, dosage and schedule may change depending on how stable your blood sugar levels are. Most types of insulin are taken by injection.Side effects of insulin include the risk of low blood sugar \u2014 a condition called hypoglycemia \u2014 diabetic ketoacidosis and high triglycerides.Weight-loss surgeryWeight-loss surgery changes the shape and function of the digestive system. This surgery may help you lose weight and manage type 2 diabetes and other conditions related to obesity. There are several surgical procedures. All of them help people lose weight by limiting how much food they can eat. Some procedures also limit the amount of nutrients the body can absorb.Weight-loss surgery is only one part of an overall treatment plan. Treatment also includes diet and nutritional supplement guidelines, exercise and mental health care.Generally, weight-loss surgery may be an option for adults living with type 2 diabetes who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.BMIis a formula that uses weight and height to estimate body fat. Depending on the severity of diabetes or the presence of other medical conditions, surgery may be an option for someone with aBMIlower than 35.BMIBMIWeight-loss surgery requires a lifelong commitment to lifestyle changes. Long-term side effects may include nutritional deficiencies and osteoporosis.PregnancyPeople living with type 2 diabetes often need to change their treatment plan during pregnancy and follow a diet that controls carbohydrates. Many people need insulin therapy during pregnancy. They also may need to stop other treatments, such as blood pressure medicines.There is an increased risk during pregnancy of developing a condition that affects the eyes called diabetic retinopathy. In some cases, this condition may get worse during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, visit an ophthalmologist during each trimester of your pregnancy and one year after you give birth. Or as often as your health care provider suggests.Signs of troubleRegularly monitoring your blood sugar levels is important to avoid severe complications. Also, be aware of symptoms that may suggest irregular blood sugar levels and the need for immediate care:High blood sugar.This condition also is called hyperglycemia. Eating certain foods or too much food, being sick, or not taking medications at the right time can cause high blood sugar. Symptoms include:High blood sugar.Frequent urination.Increased thirst.Dry mouth.Blurred vision.Fatigue.Headache.Frequent urination.Increased thirst.Dry mouth.Blurred vision.Fatigue.Headache.Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS).This life-threatening condition includes a blood sugar reading higher than 600mg/dL(33.3mmol/L).HHNSmay be more likely if you have an infection, are not taking medicines as prescribed, or take certain steroids or drugs that cause frequent urination. Symptoms include:Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS).mg/dLmmol/LHHNSDry mouth.Extreme thirst.Drowsiness.Confusion.Dark urine.Seizures.Dry mouth.Extreme thirst.Drowsiness.Confusion.Dark urine.Seizures.Diabetic ketoacidosis.Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs when a lack of insulin results in the body breaking down fat for fuel rather than sugar. This results in a buildup of acids called ketones in the bloodstream. Triggers of diabetic ketoacidosis include certain illnesses, pregnancy, trauma and medicines \u2014 including the diabetes medicines called SGLT2 inhibitors.Diabetic ketoacidosis.The toxicity of the acids made by diabetic ketoacidosis can be life-threatening. In addition to the symptoms of hyperglycemia, such as frequent urination and increased thirst, ketoacidosis may cause:Nausea.Vomiting.Abdominal pain.Shortness of breath.Fruity-smelling breath.Nausea.Vomiting.Abdominal pain.Shortness of breath.Fruity-smelling breath.Low blood sugar.If your blood sugar level drops below your target range, it's known as low blood sugar. This condition also is called hypoglycemia. Your blood sugar level can drop for many reasons, including skipping a meal, unintentionally taking more medication than usual or being more physically active than usual.

Severe aplastic anemia, in which your blood cell counts are extremely low, is life-threatening and requires immediate hospitalization.Blood transfusionsAlthough not a cure for aplastic anemia, blood transfusions can control bleeding and relieve symptoms by providing blood cells your bone marrow isn't producing. You might receive:Red blood cells.These raise red blood cell counts and help relieve anemia and fatigue.Platelets.These help prevent excessive bleeding.While there's generally no limit to the number of blood transfusions you can have, complications can sometimes arise with multiple transfusions. Transfused red blood cells contain iron that can accumulate in your body and can damage vital organs if an iron overload isn't treated. Medications can help rid your body of excess iron.Over time your body can develop antibodies to transfused blood cells, making them less effective at relieving symptoms.

A stem cell transplant, also called a bone marrow transplant, is generally the treatment of choice for people who are younger and have a matching donor \u2014 most often a sibling.If a donor is found, your diseased bone marrow is first depleted with radiation or chemotherapy. Healthy stem cells from the donor are filtered from the blood. The healthy stem cells are injected intravenously into your bloodstream, where they migrate to the bone marrow cavities and begin creating new blood cells.The procedure requires a lengthy hospital stay. After the transplant, you'll receive drugs to help prevent rejection of the donated stem cells.A stem cell transplant carries risks. Your body may reject the transplant, leading to life-threatening complications. In addition, not everyone is a candidate for transplantation or can find a suitable donor.Stem cell transplantA stem cell transplant to rebuild the bone marrow with stem cells from a donor might be the only successful treatment option for people with severe aplastic anemia.

This helps your bone marrow recover and generate new blood cells. Cyclosporine and anti-thymocyte globulin are often used together.Corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone (Medrol, Solu-Medrol), are often used with these drugs.Although effective, these drugs further weaken your immune system.

    "343.8: Cerebral palsy": "Children and adults with cerebral palsy may require lifelong care with a health care team. Your child's health care professional and a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist may oversee your child's care. Your child also may see a pediatric neurologist, therapists and mental health specialists. These experts give special attention to needs and issues that are more common in people with cerebral palsy. They work together with your child's health care professional. Together you can develop a treatment plan.There is no cure for cerebral palsy. However, there are many treatment options that may help improve your child's daily functioning. Selecting care depends on your child's specific symptoms and needs, which may change over time. Early intervention can improve outcomes.Treatment options can include medicines, therapies, surgical procedures and other treatments as needed.MedicationsMedicines that can lessen muscle tightness might be used to improve functional abilities. They also can treat pain and manage complications related to spasticity or other symptoms.Muscle or nerve injections.To treat tightening of a specific muscle, your health care professional might recommend injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), or another agent. The injections are repeated about every three months.Side effects can include pain at the injection site and mild flu-like symptoms. Other side effects include trouble breathing and swallowing.Oral muscle relaxants.Medicines such as baclofen (Fleqsuvy, Ozobax, Lyvispah), tizanidine (Zanaflex), diazepam (Valium,Diazepam Intensol) or dantrolene (Dantrium) are often used to relax muscles.Sometimes baclofen is pumped into the spinal cord with a tube, known as intrathecal baclofen.

A physical therapist also teaches you how to safely care for your child's everyday needs at home. This can include bathing and feeding your child. The therapist can provide guidance on how you can continue muscle training and exercise with your child at home between therapy visits.For the first 1 to 2 years after birth, both physical and occupational therapists work on issues such as head and trunk control, rolling, and grasping. Later, both types of therapists are involved in wheelchair assessments.Braces, splints or other supportive devices might be recommended. They may help with function, such as improved walking, and stretching stiff muscles.Occupational therapy.Occupational therapists work to help your child gain independence in daily activities at home, at school and in the community. Adaptive equipment recommended for your child can include walkers, wide-based canes, standing and seating systems, or electric wheelchairs.Speech and language therapy.Speech-language pathologists can help improve your child's ability to speak clearly or to communicate using sign language. They also can teach the use of communication devices, such as a computer and voice synthesizer, if communication is hard. Speech therapists also can address issues with eating and swallowing.Recreational therapy.Some children benefit from regular or adaptive recreational or competitive sports, such as therapeutic horseback riding or skiing. This type of therapy can help improve your child's motor skills, speech and emotional well-being. Both adults and children benefit from regular physical activity and exercise for general health and fitness.Physical therapy.Muscle training and exercises can help your child's strength, flexibility, balance, motor development and mobility.

These treatments include:Orthopedic surgery.Children with muscle tissue shortening, known as contractures, might need surgery. Surgery on bones or joints can place arms, spine, hips or legs in the correct positions. Surgical procedures also can lengthen muscles and lengthen or reposition tendons that are shortened. These corrections can lessen pain and improve mobility. The procedures also can make it easier to use a walker, braces or crutches.Cutting nerve fibers, known as selective dorsal rhizotomy.This procedure may be done when walking or moving is hard and painful and other treatments haven't helped. Surgeons cut the nerves serving specific spastic muscles. This relaxes the muscle in the legs and reduces pain. But it can cause numbness.Orthopedic surgery.Children with muscle tissue shortening, known as contractures, might need surgery.

It helps keep blood moving through a narrowed artery. If you called 911 or your local emergency number, you may be told to chew aspirin. Emergency medical providers may give you aspirin immediately.Clot busters (thrombolytics or fibrinolytics).These drugs help break up any blood clots that are blocking blood flow to the heart. The earlier a thrombolytic drug is given after a heart attack, the less the heart is damaged and the greater the chance of survival.Other blood-thinning medicines.A medicine called heparin may be given by an intravenous (IV) injection. Heparin makes the blood less sticky and less likely to form clots.Nitroglycerin.This medication widens the blood vessels. It helps improve blood flow to the heart. Nitroglycerin is used to treat sudden chest pain (angina). It's given as a pill under the tongue, as a pill to swallow or as an injection.Morphine.This medicine is given to relieve chest pain that doesn't go away with nitroglycerin.Beta blockers.These medications slow the heartbeat and decrease blood pressure. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. They are given to most people who are having a heart attack.Blood pressure medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart.Statins.These drugs help lower unhealthy cholesterol levels.

Surgeries and procedures to treat a heart attack include:Coronary angioplasty and stenting.This procedure is done to open clogged heart arteries. It may also be called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). If you've had a heart attack, this procedure is often done during a procedure to find blockages (cardiac catheterization).During angioplasty, a heart doctor (cardiologist) guides a thin, flexible tube (catheter) to the narrowed part of the heart artery. A tiny balloon is inflated to help widen the blocked artery and improve blood flow.A small wire mesh tube (stent) may be placed in the artery during angioplasty. The stent helps keep the artery open. It lowers the risk of the artery narrowing again. Some stents are coated with a medication that helps keep the arteries open.Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).This is open-heart surgery. A surgeon takes a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body to create a new path for blood in the heart. The blood then goes around the blocked or narrowed coronary artery. It\u00a0may be done as an emergency surgery at the time of a heart attack.

    "415.11: Pulmonary embolism": "Treatment of a pulmonary embolism focuses on keeping the blood clot from getting bigger and preventing new clots from forming. Prompt treatment is essential to prevent serious complications or death.Treatment can include medicines, surgery and other procedures, and ongoing care.MedicinesMedicines include different types of blood thinners and clot dissolvers.Blood thinners.These blood-thinning medicines called anticoagulants prevent existing clots from getting bigger and new clots from forming while your body works to break up the clots. Heparin is a frequently used anticoagulant that can be given through a vein or injected under the skin. It acts quickly and is often given along with an oral anticoagulant, such as warfarin (Jantovin), until the oral medicine becomes effective. This can take several days.Newer oral anticoagulants work more quickly and have fewer interactions with other medicines. Some have the advantage of being given by mouth until they're effective, without the need for heparin. However, all anticoagulants have side effects, and bleeding is the most common.Clot dissolvers.While clots usually dissolve on their own, sometimes thrombolytics \u2014 medicines that dissolve clots \u2014 given through a vein can dissolve clots quickly. Because these clot-busting medicines can cause sudden and severe bleeding, they usually are reserved for life-threatening situations.Blood thinners.These blood-thinning medicines called anticoagulants prevent existing clots from getting bigger and new clots from forming while your body works to break up the clots.

The filter can help keep clots from going to your lungs. This procedure is usually only used for people who can't take anticoagulant drugs or those who get blood clots even with the use of anticoagulants.

    "427.89: Arrhythmia": "Treatment for a heart arrhythmia depends on whether the heart is beating too fast or too slow. Some heart arrhythmias do not need treatment. Your healthcare team may suggest regular checkups to watch your condition.Heart arrhythmia treatment is usually only needed if the irregular heartbeat causes significant symptoms or puts you at risk of more-serious heart problems. Treatment for heart arrhythmias may include medicines, special actions called vagal maneuvers, procedures or surgery.MedicinesMedicines used to treat heart arrhythmias depend on the type of irregular heartbeat and possible complications.For example, most people with tachycardia are given medicine to control the heart rate and rhythm.If you have atrial fibrillation, blood thinners may be given to prevent blood clots.TherapiesOther treatments for heart arrhythmias include:Vagal maneuvers.These are simple but specific actions that can slow the heart rate. They include coughing, bearing down as if having a bowel movement and putting an ice pack on the face. These actions affect the vagus nerve. The nerve helps control the heartbeat. Vagal maneuvers may be recommended if you have a very fast heartbeat due to supraventricular tachycardia. Vagal maneuvers don't work for all types of arrhythmias.Cardioversion.Paddles or patches on the chest are used to give an electrical shock to the heart and help reset the heart rhythm. Cardioversion is typically used when vagal maneuvers and medicines don't work.

If it finds one, it sends a brief shock to reset the heart rhythm.Treatment for heart arrhythmias also may involve a procedure or surgery to place a heart device in your body. Sometimes, open-heart surgery is needed to stop or prevent an irregular heartbeat.Types of procedures and surgeries used to treat heart arrhythmias include:Catheter ablation.In this procedure, the doctor places one or more catheters into blood vessels to the heart. Sensors at the catheter tips use heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in your heart. The scars block irregular heart signals and restore the heartbeat.Pacemaker.If slow heartbeats don't have a cause that can be fixed, a pacemaker may be needed. A pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest to help control the heartbeat.Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).This device is placed under the skin near the collarbone. It continuously checks the heart rhythm. If the device finds an irregular heartbeat, it sends out low- or high-energy shocks to reset the heart's rhythm.You may need this device if you have a high risk of dangerously fast or irregular heartbeats in the lower heart chambers. Such conditions are called ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Other reasons for anICDinclude a history of sudden cardiac arrest or conditions that increase its risk.Maze procedure.In the maze procedure, a surgeon makes tiny cuts in the upper half of the heart to create a pattern of scar tissue. The pattern is called a maze. The heart's signals can't pass through scar tissue. This treatment can block stray electrical heart signals that cause some types of fast heartbeats.The maze procedure is usually only done if you don't get better with other treatments or if you're already having open-heart surgery for another reason.Coronary bypass graft surgery.If you have severe coronary artery disease with an irregular heartbeat, you may need this type of heart surgery. The surgery creates a new path for blood to flow around a blocked or partially blocked artery in the heart.Catheter ablation.In this procedure, the doctor places one or more catheters into blood vessels to the heart.

    "493.90: Asthma": "Avoiding the workplace substance that causes your symptoms is critical. However, once you become sensitive to a substance, tiny amounts may trigger asthma symptoms, even if you wear a mask or respirator.The goal of treatment is to prevent symptoms and stop an asthma attack in progress. You may need medications for successful treatment. The same medication guidelines are used to treat both occupational and nonoccupational asthma.The right medication for you depends on many things. These include your age, symptoms, asthma triggers and what seems to work best to keep your asthma under control.Long-term control medicationsInhaled corticosteroids.Inhaled corticosteroids reduce inflammation and have a relatively low risk of side effects.Leukotriene modifiers.These medications are alternatives to corticosteroids. Sometimes, they're taken with corticosteroids.Long-acting beta agonists (LABAs).LABAsopen the airways and reduce inflammation.

    "741.00: Spina bifida": "Spina bifida treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Spina bifida occulta often doesn't require any treatment at all, but other types of spina bifida do.Surgery before birthNerve function in babies with spina bifida can worsen after birth if spina bifida isn't treated. Prenatal surgery for spina bifida (fetal surgery) takes place before the 26th week of pregnancy. Surgeons expose the pregnant mother's uterus surgically, open the uterus and repair the baby's spinal cord. In select patients, this procedure can be performed less invasively with a special surgical tool (fetoscope) inserted into the uterus.Research suggests that children with spina bifida who had fetal surgery may have reduced disability and be less likely to need crutches or other walking devices. Fetal surgery may also reduce the risk of hydrocephalus. Ask your doctor whether this procedure may be appropriate for you. Discuss the potential benefits and risks, such as possible premature delivery and other complications, for you and your baby.It's important to have a comprehensive evaluation to determine whether fetal surgery is feasible. This specialized surgery should only be done at a health care facility that has experienced fetal surgery experts, a multispecialty team approach and neonatal intensive care. Typically the team includes a fetal surgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, fetal cardiologist and neonatologist.Cesarean birthMany babies with myelomeningocele tend to be in a feet-first (breech) position. If your baby is in this position or if your doctor has detected a large cyst or sac, cesarean birth may be a safer way to deliver your baby.Surgery after birthMyelomeningocele requires surgery to close the opening in the baby's back within 72 hours of birth. Performing the surgery early can help minimize the risk of infection associated with the exposed nerves. It may also help protect the spinal cord from more trauma.During the procedure, a neurosurgeon places the spinal cord and exposed tissue inside the baby's body and covers them with muscle and skin. At the same time, the neurosurgeon may place a shunt in the baby's brain to control hydrocephalus.Treatment for complicationsIn babies with myelomeningocele, irreparable nerve damage has likely already occurred and ongoing care from a multispecialty team of surgeons, physicians and therapists is usually needed. Babies with myelomeningocele may need more surgery for a variety of complications. Treatment for complications \u2014 such as weak legs, bladder and bowel problems, or hydrocephalus \u2014 typically begins soon after birth.Depending on the severity of spina bifida and the complications, treatment options may include:Walking and mobility aids.Some babies may start exercises to prepare their legs for walking with braces or crutches when they're older. Some children may need walkers or a wheelchair. Mobility aids, along with regular physical therapy, can help a child become independent. Even children who need a wheelchair can learn to function very well and become self-sufficient.Bowel and bladder management.Routine bowel and bladder evaluations and management plans help reduce the risk of organ damage and illness. Evaluations include X-rays, kidney scans, ultrasounds, blood tests and bladder function studies. These evaluations will be more frequent in the first few years of life but less often as children grow. A specialist in pediatric urology with experience in evaluating and performing surgery on children with spina bifida may offer the most effective management options.Bowel management may include oral medications, suppositories, enemas, surgery or a combination of these approaches.Bladder management may include medications, using catheters to empty the bladder, surgery or a combination of treatments.Surgery for hydrocephalus.Most babies with myelomeningocele will need a surgically placed tube that allows fluid in the brain to drain into the abdomen (ventricular shunt). This tube might be placed just after birth, during the surgery to close the sac on the lower back or later as fluid accumulates. A less invasive procedure, called endoscopic third ventriculostomy, may be an option. But candidates must be carefully chosen and meet certain criteria. During the procedure, the surgeon uses a small video camera to see inside the brain and makes a hole in the bottom of or between the ventricles so cerebrospinal fluid can flow out of the brain.Treatment and management of other complications.Special equipment such as bath chairs, commode chairs and standing frames may help with daily functioning. Whatever the issue \u2014 orthopedic complications, tethered spinal cord,GIissues, skin problems or others \u2014 most spina bifida complications can be treated or at least managed to improve quality of life.Walking and mobility aids.Some babies may start exercises to prepare their legs for walking with braces or crutches when they're older.

Their primary care doctors evaluate growth, the need for vaccinations and general medical issues, and they coordinate medical care.Children with spina bifida also often need treatment and ongoing care from:Physical medicine and rehabilitationNeurologyNeurosurgeryUrologyOrthopedicsPhysical therapyOccupational therapySpecial education teachersSocial workersDietitiansPhysical medicine and rehabilitationNeurologyNeurosurgeryUrologyOrthopedicsPhysical therapyOccupational therapySpecial education teachersSocial workersDietitiansParents and other caregivers are a key part of the team.

    "775.5: Hyponatremia": "Hyponatremia treatment is aimed at addressing the underlying cause, if possible.If you have moderate, chronic hyponatremia due to your diet, diuretics or drinking too much water, your doctor may recommend temporarily cutting back on fluids. He or she may also suggest adjusting your diuretic use to increase the level of sodium in your blood.If you have severe, acute hyponatremia, you'll need more-aggressive treatment. Options include:Intravenous fluids.Your doctor may recommend IV sodium solution to slowly raise the sodium levels in your blood. This requires a stay in the hospital for frequent monitoring of sodium levels as too rapid of a correction is dangerous.Medications.You may take medications to manage the signs and symptoms of hyponatremia, such as headaches, nausea and seizures.Intravenous fluids.Your doctor may recommend IV sodium solution to slowly raise the sodium levels in your blood.

    "779.89: Complications of pregnancy": "The goals of treatment for cholestasis of pregnancy are to ease itching and prevent complications in your baby.Ease itchingTo soothe intense itching, your pregnancy care provider may recommend:Taking a prescription medicine called ursodiol (Actigall, Urso, Urso Forte). This medicine helps to lower the level of bile acids in your blood. Other medicines to relieve itching also may be an option.Soaking itchy areas in cool or lukewarm water.Taking a prescription medicine called ursodiol (Actigall, Urso, Urso Forte).

Your pregnancy care provider may recommend close monitoring of your baby while you're pregnant.Monitoring may include:Nonstress testing.During a nonstress test, your pregnancy care provider will check your baby's heart rate, and how much the heart rate increases with activity.Fetal biophysical profile (BPP).This series of tests helps monitor your baby's well-being. It provides information about your baby's heart rate, movement, muscle tone, breathing movements and amount of amniotic fluid.Nonstress testing.During a nonstress test, your pregnancy care provider will check your baby's heart rate, and how much the heart rate increases with activity.Nonstress testing.Fetal biophysical profile (BPP).This series of tests helps monitor your baby's well-being.

Early term delivery, around 37 weeks, may lower the risk of stillbirth. Vaginal delivery is recommended by induction of labor unless there are other reasons a cesarean section is needed.Future birth controlA history of cholestasis of pregnancy may increase the risk of symptoms returning with contraceptives that contain estrogen, so other methods of birth control are generally recommended. These include progestin-containing contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs) or barrier methods, such as condoms or diaphragms.Request an appointmentRequest an appointment",
    "909.2: Acute radiation syndrome": "The treatment goals for radiation sickness are to prevent further radioactive contamination; treat life-threatening injuries, such as from burns and trauma; reduce symptoms; and manage pain.DecontaminationDecontamination involves removing external radioactive particles. Removing clothing and shoes eliminates about 90 percent of external contamination. Gently washing with water and soap removes additional radiation particles from the skin.Decontamination prevents radioactive materials from spreading more. It also lowers the risk of internal contamination from inhalation, ingestion or open wounds.Treatment for damaged bone marrowA protein called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which promotes the growth of white blood cells, may counter the effect of radiation sickness on bone marrow. Treatment with this protein-based medication, which includes filgrastim (Neupogen), sargramostim (Leukine) and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), may increase white blood cell production and help prevent subsequent infections.If you have severe damage to bone marrow, you may also receive transfusions of red blood cells or blood platelets.Treatment for internal contaminationSome treatments may reduce damage to internal organs caused by radioactive particles. Medical personnel would use these treatments only if you've been exposed to a specific type of radiation. These treatments include the following:Potassium iodide (ThyroShield, Iosat).This is a nonradioactive form of iodine.Iodine is essential for proper thyroid function. If you're exposed to significant radiation, your thyroid will absorb radioactive iodine (radioiodine) just as it would other forms of iodine. The radioiodine is eventually cleared from the body in urine.If you take potassium iodide, it may fill \"vacancies\" in the thyroid and prevent the absorption of radioiodine. Potassium iodide isn't a cure-all and is most effective if taken within a day of exposure.Prussian blue (Radiogardase).This type of dye binds to particles of radioactive elements known as cesium and thallium. The radioactive particles are then excreted in feces. This treatment speeds up the elimination of the radioactive particles and reduces the amount of radiation cells may absorb.Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA).This substance binds to metals.DTPAbinds to particles of the radioactive elements plutonium, americium and curium. The radioactive particles pass out of the body in urine, thereby reducing the amount of radiation absorbed.Potassium iodide (ThyroShield, Iosat).This is a nonradioactive form of iodine.Iodine is essential for proper thyroid function.

    "998.11: Bleeding": "Treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding is based on a number of factors. These include:Your overall health and medical history.The cause of the condition and how serious it is.How well you tolerate certain medicines or procedures.The chance that your periods will soon become less heavy.Your plans to have children.How the condition affects your lifestyle.Your opinion or personal choices.Your overall health and medical history.The cause of the condition and how serious it is.How well you tolerate certain medicines or procedures.The chance that your periods will soon become less heavy.Your plans to have children.How the condition affects your lifestyle.Your opinion or personal choices.MedicinesMedicines for heavy menstrual bleeding may include:Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs.NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), help reduce menstrual blood loss.NSAIDsmay also make menstrual cramps less painful.Tranexamic acid.Tranexamic acid (Lysteda) helps reduce menstrual blood loss. This medicine only needs to be taken at the time of bleeding.Oral contraceptives.Aside from birth control, oral contraceptives can help regulate menstrual cycles and ease menstrual bleeding that is heavy or lasts a long time.Oral progesterone.The natural hormone progesterone can help fix hormone imbalance and reduce heavy menstrual bleeding. The synthetic form of progesterone is called progestin.HormonalIUD(Mirena, Liletta, others).This intrauterine device releases a type of progestin called levonorgestrel. It makes the uterine lining thin and reduces menstrual blood flow and cramping.Other medicines.Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists are also called GnRH medicines. They help control heavy uterine bleeding. Relugolix combined with an estrogen and progestin (Myfembree) may help control bleeding caused by fibroids. Elagolix with an estrogen and progestin (Oriahnn) is used to treat fibroid-related bleeding.

If your iron levels are low but you're not yet anemic, you may be started on iron supplements instead of waiting until you become anemic.ProceduresYou may need surgery for heavy menstrual bleeding if medicines do not help. Treatment options include:Dilation and curettage, also called a D&C.In this procedure, your doctor opens your cervix. This also is called dilating the cervix. The doctor then scrapes or suctions tissue from the lining of your uterus. This also is known as curettage. You may have aD&Cto find the source of abnormal uterine bleeding. Causes of bleeding may include polyps, fibroids or cancer of the uterus. If you've had a miscarriage, you may need aD&Cto completely empty the uterus. Hysteroscopy is often used withD&Cto help doctors find the source of bleeding in the uterus.Uterine artery embolization.The goal of this procedure is to block blood flow to uterine fibroids. Blocking blood flow to fibroids helps to shrink them. During the procedure, the surgeon passes a catheter through the large artery in the thigh. This also is known as the femoral artery. The surgeon guides the catheter to the blood vessels in the uterus and injects tiny beads or sponges to reduce blood flow to the fibroid.Focused ultrasound.This procedure shrinks fibroids by targeting and destroying fibroids through ultrasound waves and radiofrequency energy. It needs no incisions.Myomectomy.This is the surgical removal of uterine fibroids. Depending on the size, number and location of the fibroids, your surgeon may perform the myomectomy through several small incisions in the abdomen. This is known also as the laparoscopic approach. Or the surgeon may put a thin, flexible tube into the vagina and cervix to see and remove fibroids or polyps inside the uterus. This also is called the hysteroscopic approach.Endometrial ablation.This procedure involves destroying the lining of the uterus. The process of destroying tissue also is known as ablation. The surgeon uses a laser, radio waves or heat applied to the lining of the uterus to destroy the tissue.After endometrial ablation, you may have much lighter periods. Pregnancy after endometrial ablation isn't likely but is possible and could be dangerous. Using reliable or permanent birth control until menopause is recommended.Endometrial resection.The surgeon uses an electrosurgical wire loop to remove the lining of the uterus. Pregnancy isn't recommended after this procedure.Hysterectomy.In this procedure, the uterus and cervix are removed. It ends menstrual periods and the ability to get pregnant. Hysterectomy is performed under anesthesia and may require a short hospital stay. Early menopause may occur if the ovaries are removed. The procedure to remove both ovaries is called bilateral oophorectomy.Dilation and curettage, also called a D&C.In this procedure, your doctor opens your cervix.

    "998.12: Hematoma": "Hematomas that are small and produce no signs or symptoms don't need to be removed. However, signs and symptoms can appear or worsen days or weeks after the injury. As a result, you might have to be watched for neurological changes, have your intracranial pressure monitored and undergo repeated headCTscans.CTIf you take blood-thinning medication, such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), you may need therapy to reverse the effects of the medication. This will reduce the risk of further bleeding. Options for reversing blood thinners include giving vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma.SurgeryHematoma treatment often involves surgery. The type of surgery depends on the type of hematoma you have. Options include:Surgical drainage.If the blood is in one area and has changed from a solid clot to a liquid, your doctor might create a small hole in your skull and use suction to remove the liquid.Craniotomy.Large hematomas might require that a section of your skull be opened (craniotomy) to remove the blood.Surgical drainage.If the blood is in one area and has changed from a solid clot to a liquid, your doctor might create a small hole in your skull and use suction to remove the liquid.Surgical drainage.Craniotomy.Large hematomas might require that a section of your skull be opened (craniotomy) to remove the blood.Craniotomy.RecoveryRecovery after an intracranial hematoma can take a long time, and you might not recover completely. The greatest period of recovery is up to three months after the injury, usually with lesser improvement after that. If you continue to have neurological problems after treatment, you might need occupational and physical therapy.Request an appointmentRequest an appointment",

    "244.9: Hypothyroidism": "Treatment for hypothyroidism usually includes taking the thyroid hormone medicine levothyroxine (Levo-T, Synthroid, others) every day. This medicine is taken by mouth. It returns hormone levels to a healthy range, eliminating symptoms of hypothyroidism.You'll likely start to feel better one or two weeks after you begin treatment. Treatment with levothyroxine likely will be lifelong. Because the dosage you need may change, your health care provider may check yourTSHlevel every year.TSHFinding the right dosageTo find the right dosage of levothyroxine for you, your health care provider checks your level ofTSHabout 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine. You may need another blood test to checkTSHagain six months later. Too much levothyroxine can cause side effects, such as:TSHTSHTiredness.Increased appetite.Sleep problems.Shakiness.Pounding of the heart, sometimes called heart palpitations.Tiredness.Increased appetite.Sleep problems.Shakiness.Pounding of the heart, sometimes called heart palpitations.Levothyroxine typically causes no side effects when used in the correct dose. If you change brands of the medicine, tell your health care provider, as the dosage may need to change.If you have coronary artery disease or severe hypothyroidism, your health care provider may start treatment with a smaller amount of medicine and then slowly increase the dosage. This allows your heart to adjust to the rise in your body's metabolism.Taking levothyroxine correctlyLevothyroxine is best taken on an empty stomach at the same time every day. Ideally, you take the hormone in the morning, and then wait 30 to 60 minutes before you eat or take other medicine. If you take the medicine at bedtime, wait to take it until at least four hours after your last meal or snack.Don't skip doses or stop taking the medicine because you feel better. If you do, it's likely that the symptoms of hypothyroidism will slowly return. If you miss a dose of levothyroxine, take two pills the next day.Some medicines, supplements and even some foods may affect your body's ability to absorb levothyroxine. Talk to your health care provider if you eat large amounts of soy products, or if you typically eat a high-fiber diet. Also, tell your provider if you take other medicines, especially:Iron supplements or multivitamins that contain iron.Aluminum hydroxide, which is found in some antacids.Calcium supplements.Iron supplements or multivitamins that contain iron.Aluminum hydroxide, which is found in some antacids.Calcium supplements.Subclinical hypothyroidismIf you are diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism, talk about treatment with your health care provider. For a mild rise inTSH, thyroid hormone medicine may not be useful. If yourTSHlevel is higher, but still in the subclinical range, thyroid hormones may improve some symptoms.TSHTSHMore InformationHypothyroidism dietHypothyroidism: Can calcium supplements interfere with treatment?Hypothyroidism: Should I take iodine supplements?Soy: Does it worsen hypothyroidism?Show more related informationMore InformationHypothyroidism dietHypothyroidism: Can calcium supplements interfere with treatment?Hypothyroidism: Should I take iodine supplements?Soy: Does it worsen hypothyroidism?Show more related informationHypothyroidism dietHypothyroidism: Can calcium supplements interfere with treatment?Hypothyroidism: Should I take iodine supplements?Soy: Does it worsen hypothyroidism?Hypothyroidism dietHypothyroidism dietHypothyroidism: Can calcium supplements interfere with treatment?Hypothyroidism: Can calcium supplements interfere with treatment?Hypothyroidism: Should I take iodine supplements?Hypothyroidism: Should I take iodine supplements?Soy: Does it worsen hypothyroidism?Soy: Does it worsen hypothyroidism?Show more related informationRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

    "300.00: Anxiety disorder": "Treatment decisions are based on how significantly generalized anxiety disorder is affecting your ability to function in your daily life. The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you.PsychotherapyAlso known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective form of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder.Generally a short-term treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on teaching you specific skills to directly manage your worries and help you gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. Through this process, your symptoms improve as you build on your initial success.MedicationsSeveral types of medications are used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects.Antidepressants.Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments. Examples of antidepressants used to treat generalized anxiety disorder include escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva). Your doctor also may recommend other antidepressants.Buspirone.An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be used on an ongoing basis. As with most antidepressants, it typically takes up to several weeks to become fully effective.Benzodiazepines.In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepine for relief of anxiety symptoms. These sedatives are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these medications aren't a good choice if you have or had problems with alcohol or drug abuse.Antidepressants.Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments.

    "428.0: Heart failure": "Treatment of heart failure may depend on the cause. Treatment often includes lifestyle changes and medicines. If another health condition is causing the heart to fail, treating it may reverse heart failure.Some people with heart failure need surgery to open blocked arteries or to place a device to help the heart work better.With treatment, symptoms of heart failure may improve.MedicationsA combination of medicines may be used to treat heart failure. The specific medicines used depend on the cause of heart failure and the symptoms. Medicines to treat heart failure include:Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.These drugs relax blood vessels to lower blood pressure, improve blood flow and decrease the strain on the heart. Examples include enalapril (Vasotec, Epaned), lisinopril (Zestril, Qbrelis) and captopril.Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).These drugs have many of the same benefits asACEinhibitors. They may be an option for people who can't tolerateACEinhibitors. They include losartan (Cozaar), valsartan (Diovan) and candesartan (Atacand).Angiotensin receptor plus neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs).This medicine uses two blood pressure drugs to treat heart failure. The combination medicine is sacubitril-valsartan (Entresto). It's used to treat some people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. It may help prevent the need for a hospital stay in those people.Beta blockers.These medicines slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure. They reduce the symptoms of heart failure and help the heart work better. If you have heart failure, beta blockers may help you live longer. Examples include carvedilol (Coreg), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL, Kapspargo Sprinkle) and bisoprolol.Diuretics.Often called water pills, these medicines make you urinate more frequently. This helps prevent fluid buildup in your body. Diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix, Furoscix), also decrease fluid in the lungs, so it's easier to breathe.Some diuretics make the body lose potassium and magnesium. Your health care provider may recommend supplements to treat this. If you're taking a diuretic, you may have regular blood tests to check your potassium and magnesium levels.Potassium-sparing diuretics.Also called aldosterone antagonists, these drugs include spironolactone (Aldactone, Carospir) and eplerenone (Inspra). They may help people with severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) live longer.Unlike some other diuretics, these medicines can raise the level of potassium in the blood to dangerous levels. Talk to your health care provider about your diet and potassium intake.Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.These medicines help lower blood sugar. They are often prescribed with diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. But they're also one of the first treatments for heart failure. That's because several studies showed that the medicine lowered the risk of hospital stays and death in people with certain types of heart failure \u2014 even if they didn't have diabetes. These medicines include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance).Digoxin (Lanoxin).This drug, also called digitalis, helps the heart squeeze better to pump blood. It also tends to slow the heartbeat. Digoxin reduces heart failure symptoms in people withHFrEF. It may be more likely to be given to someone with a heart rhythm problem, such as atrial fibrillation.Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (BiDil).This drug combination helps relax blood vessels. It may be added to your treatment plan if you have severe heart failure symptoms andACEinhibitors or beta blockers haven't helped.Vericiguat (Verquvo).This medicine for chronic heart failure is taken once a day by mouth. It's a type of drug called an oral soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator. In studies, people with high-risk heart failure who took this medicine had fewer hospital stays for heart failure and heart disease-related deaths compared with those who got a dummy pill.Positive inotropes.These medicines may be given by IV to people with certain types of severe heart failure who are in the hospital. Positive inotropes can help the heart pump blood better and maintain blood pressure. Long-term use of these medicines has been linked to an increased risk of death in some people. Talk to your health care provider about the benefits and risks of these drugs.Other medicines.Your health care provider may prescribe other medicines to treat specific symptoms. For example, some people may receive nitrates for chest pain, statins to lower cholesterol or blood thinners to help prevent blood clots.Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.These drugs relax blood vessels to lower blood pressure, improve blood flow and decrease the strain on the heart.

While in the hospital, you may receive:Medicines to relieve your symptoms.More medicines to help your heart pump better.Oxygen through a mask or small tubes placed in your nose.Medicines to relieve your symptoms.More medicines to help your heart pump better.Oxygen through a mask or small tubes placed in your nose.If you have severe heart failure, you may need to use supplemental oxygen for a long time.Surgery or other proceduresSurgery or other treatment to place a heart device may be recommended to treat the problem that led to heart failure.Surgery or other procedures for heart failure may include:Coronary bypass surgery.You may need this surgery if severely blocked arteries are causing your heart failure. The surgery involves taking a healthy blood vessel from the leg, arm or chest and connecting it below and above the blocked arteries in the heart. The new pathway improves blood flow to the heart muscle.Heart valve repair or replacement.If a damaged heart valve causes heart failure, your provider may recommend repairing or replacing the valve. There are many different types of heart valve repair. The type needed depends on the cause of the heart valve problem.Heart valve repair or replacement may be done as open-heart or minimally invasive surgery.Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).AnICDis used to prevent complications of heart failure. It isn't a treatment for heart failure itself. AnICDis a device similar to a pacemaker. It's implanted under the skin in the chest with wires leading through the veins and into the heart.TheICDmonitors the heartbeat. If the heart starts beating at a dangerous rhythm, theICDtries to correct the beat. If the heart stops, the device shocks it back into regular rhythm. AnICDcan also work as a pacemaker and speed up a slow heartbeat.Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).Also called biventricular pacing,CRTis a treatment for heart failure in people whose lower heart chambers aren't pumping in sync with each other. A device sends electrical signals to the lower heart chambers. The signals tell the chambers to squeeze in a more coordinated way. This improves the pumping of blood out of the heart.CRTmay be used with anICD.Ventricular assist device (VAD).AVADhelps pump blood from the lower chambers of the heart to the rest of the body. It's also called a mechanical circulatory support device. Although aVADcan be placed in one or both lower chambers of the heart, it's usually placed in the lower left one.Your health care provider may recommend aVADif you're waiting for a heart transplant. Sometimes, aVADis used as a permanent treatment for people who have heart failure but who aren't good candidates for a heart transplant.Heart transplant.Some people have such severe heart failure that surgery or medicines don't help. These people may need to have their hearts replaced with a healthy donor heart.A heart transplant isn't the right treatment for everyone. A team of health care providers at a transplant center helps determine whether the procedure may be safe and beneficial for you.Coronary bypass surgery.You may need this surgery if severely blocked arteries are causing your heart failure.

This is called palliative care. Anyone who has a serious or life-threatening illness can benefit from this type of care. It can be used to treat symptoms of the disease or to ease the side effects of treatment.In some people with heart failure, medicines no longer work and a heart transplant or device isn't an option. If this occurs, special end-of-life care may be recommended. This is called hospice care.Hospice care allows family and friends \u2014 with the aid of nurses, social workers and trained volunteers \u2014 to care for and comfort a loved one.

    "443.9: Peripheral artery disease": "The goals of treatment for peripheral artery disease are:Manage symptoms, such as leg pain, so exercise isn't uncomfortableImprove artery health to reduce the risk of heart attack and strokeManage symptoms, such as leg pain, so exercise isn't uncomfortableImprove artery health to reduce the risk of heart attack and strokeTreatments for peripheral artery disease includes lifestyle changes and sometimes, medication.Lifestyle changes can help improve symptoms, especially early in the course of peripheral artery disease. If you smoke, quitting is the single most important thing you can do to reduce the risk of complications. Walking or doing other exercise on a regular, scheduled basis (supervised exercise training) can improve symptoms dramatically.MedicationsIf peripheral artery disease (PAD) is causing symptoms, your provider may prescribe medicine. Medications forPADmay include:PADCholesterol drugs.Medications called statins are commonly prescribed for people with peripheral artery disease. Statins help lower bad cholesterol and reduce plaque buildup in the arteries. The drugs also lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes. If you havePAD, ask your provider what your cholesterol numbers should be.Blood pressure drugs.Uncontrolled high blood pressure can make arteries stiff and hard. This can slow the flow of blood. Ask your health care provider what blood pressure goal is best for you. If you have high blood pressure, your provider may prescribe medications to lower it.Medications to control blood sugar.If you have diabetes, controlling your blood sugar levels becomes even more important. Talk with your provider about your blood sugar goals and how to reach them.Medications to prevent blood clots.Peripheral artery disease is related to reduced blood flow to the limbs. So, medicines may be given to improve blood flow. Aspirin or another medication, such as clopidogrel (Plavix), may be used to prevent blood clotting.Medications for leg pain.The drug cilostazol thins the blood and widens blood vessels. It increases blood flow to the limbs. The drug specifically helps treat leg pain in people who have peripheral artery disease. Common side effects of this medication include headache and diarrhea. An alternative medication is pentoxifylline. Side effects are rare with this medication, but it generally doesn't work as well as cilostazol.Cholesterol drugs.Medications called statins are commonly prescribed for people with peripheral artery disease.

Aspirin or another medication, such as clopidogrel (Plavix), may be used to prevent blood clotting.Medications to prevent blood clots.Medications for leg pain.The drug cilostazol thins the blood and widens blood vessels. It increases blood flow to the limbs. The drug specifically helps treat leg pain in people who have peripheral artery disease. Common side effects of this medication include headache and diarrhea. An alternative medication is pentoxifylline. Side effects are rare with this medication, but it generally doesn't work as well as cilostazol.Medications for leg pain.Surgeries or other proceduresGraft bypassEnlarge imageCloseGraft bypassGraft bypassA graft is used to redirect blood flow around a blocked or narrowed artery.

It can diagnose and treat a blocked vessel at the same time. The health care provider guides a thin, flexible tube (catheter) to the narrowed part of the artery. A tiny balloon is inflated to widen the blocked artery and improve blood flow. A small wire mesh tube (stent) may be placed in the artery to keep the artery open.Bypass surgery.The surgeon creates a path around the blocked artery using either a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body or a synthetic one.Thrombolytic therapy.If a blood clot is blocking an artery, a clot-dissolving drug may be given directly into the affected artery.Angioplasty and stent placement.This procedure is done to open clogged arteries.

If they don't help, your provider may recommend medicine to lower your blood pressure.MedicationsThe type of medicine used to treat hypertension depends on your overall health and how high your blood pressure is. Two or more blood pressure drugs often work better than one. It can take some time to find the medicine or combination of medicines that works best for you.When taking blood pressure medicine, it's important to know your goal blood pressure level. You should aim for a blood pressure treatment goal of less than 130/80mm Hgif:You're a healthy adult age 65 or olderYou're a healthy adult younger than age 65 with a 10% or higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 yearsYou have chronic kidney disease, diabetes or coronary artery diseaseThe ideal blood pressure goal can vary with age and health conditions, particularly if you're older than age 65.Medicines used to treat high blood pressure include:Water pills (diuretics).These drugs help remove sodium and water from the body. They are often the first medicines used to treat high blood pressure.There are different classes of diuretics, including thiazide, loop and potassium sparing. Which one your provider recommends depends on your blood pressure measurements and other health conditions, such as kidney disease or heart failure. Diuretics commonly used to treat blood pressure include chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide) and others.A common side effect of diuretics is increased urination. Urinating a lot can reduce potassium levels. A good balance of potassium is necessary to help the heart beat correctly. If you have low potassium (hypokalemia), your provider may recommend a potassium-sparing diuretic that contains triamterene.Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.These drugs help relax blood vessels. They block the formation of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. Examples include lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), benazepril (Lotensin), captopril and others.Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).These drugs also relax blood vessels. They block the action, not the formation, of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) include candesartan (Atacand), losartan (Cozaar) and others.Calcium channel blockers.These drugs help relax the muscles of the blood vessels. Some slow your heart rate. They include amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and others. Calcium channel blockers may work better for older people and Black people than do angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors alone.Don't eat or drink grapefruit products when taking calcium channel blockers. Grapefruit increases blood levels of certain calcium channel blockers, which can be dangerous.

They help lower the effects of natural chemicals that narrow blood vessels. Alpha blockers include doxazosin (Cardura), prazosin (Minipress) and others.Alpha-beta blockers.Alpha-beta blockers block nerve signals to blood vessels and slow the heartbeat. They reduce the amount of blood that must be pumped through the vessels. Alpha-beta blockers include carvedilol (Coreg) and labetalol (Trandate).Beta blockers.These medicines reduce the workload on the heart and widen the blood vessels. This helps the heart beat slower and with less force. Beta blockers include atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL, Kapspargo sprinkle) and others.Beta blockers aren't usually recommended as the only medicine prescribed. They may work best when combined with other blood pressure drugs.Aldosterone antagonists.These drugs may be used to treat resistant hypertension. They block the effect of a natural chemical that can lead to salt and fluid buildup in the body. Examples are spironolactone (Aldactone) and eplerenone (Inspra).Renin inhibitors.Aliskiren (Tekturna) slows the production of renin, an enzyme produced by the kidneys that starts a chain of chemical steps that increases blood pressure.Due to a risk of serious complications, including stroke, you shouldn't take aliskiren withACEinhibitors orARBs.Vasodilators.These medicines stop the muscles in the artery walls from tightening. This prevents the arteries from narrowing. Examples include hydralazine and minoxidil.Central-acting agents.These medicines prevent the brain from telling the nervous system to increase the heart rate and narrow the blood vessels. Examples include clonidine (Catapres, Kapvay), guanfacine (Intuniv) and methyldopa.Always take blood pressure medicines as prescribed. Never skip a dose or abruptly stop taking blood pressure medicines. Suddenly stopping certain ones, such as beta blockers, can cause a sharp increase in blood pressure called rebound hypertension.If you skip doses because of cost, side effects or forgetfulness, talk to your care provider about solutions.

These include:Your overall health and medical history.The cause of the condition and how serious it is.How well you tolerate certain medicines or procedures.The chance that your periods will soon become less heavy.Your plans to have children.How the condition affects your lifestyle.Your opinion or personal choices.Your overall health and medical history.The cause of the condition and how serious it is.How well you tolerate certain medicines or procedures.The chance that your periods will soon become less heavy.Your plans to have children.How the condition affects your lifestyle.Your opinion or personal choices.MedicinesMedicines for heavy menstrual bleeding may include:Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs.NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), help reduce menstrual blood loss.NSAIDsmay also make menstrual cramps less painful.Tranexamic acid.Tranexamic acid (Lysteda) helps reduce menstrual blood loss. This medicine only needs to be taken at the time of bleeding.Oral contraceptives.Aside from birth control, oral contraceptives can help regulate menstrual cycles and ease menstrual bleeding that is heavy or lasts a long time.Oral progesterone.The natural hormone progesterone can help fix hormone imbalance and reduce heavy menstrual bleeding. The synthetic form of progesterone is called progestin.HormonalIUD(Mirena, Liletta, others).This intrauterine device releases a type of progestin called levonorgestrel. It makes the uterine lining thin and reduces menstrual blood flow and cramping.Other medicines.Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists are also called GnRH medicines. They help control heavy uterine bleeding. Relugolix combined with an estrogen and progestin (Myfembree) may help control bleeding caused by fibroids. Elagolix with an estrogen and progestin (Oriahnn) is used to treat fibroid-related bleeding. Elagolix alone (Orilissa) may help control bleeding caused by endometriosis.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs.NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), help reduce menstrual blood loss.NSAIDsmay also make menstrual cramps less painful.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs.NSAIDsNSAIDsTranexamic acid.Tranexamic acid (Lysteda) helps reduce menstrual blood loss.

Elagolix alone (Orilissa) may help control bleeding caused by endometriosis.Other medicines.If you have heavy menstrual bleeding from taking hormone medicine, you may need to stop or change your medicine.If you have anemia due to heavy menstrual bleeding, you may need to take iron supplements. If your iron levels are low but you're not yet anemic, you may be started on iron supplements instead of waiting until you become anemic.ProceduresYou may need surgery for heavy menstrual bleeding if medicines do not help. Treatment options include:Dilation and curettage, also called a D&C.In this procedure, your doctor opens your cervix. This also is called dilating the cervix. The doctor then scrapes or suctions tissue from the lining of your uterus. This also is known as curettage. You may have aD&Cto find the source of abnormal uterine bleeding. Causes of bleeding may include polyps, fibroids or cancer of the uterus. If you've had a miscarriage, you may need aD&Cto completely empty the uterus. Hysteroscopy is often used withD&Cto help doctors find the source of bleeding in the uterus.Uterine artery embolization.The goal of this procedure is to block blood flow to uterine fibroids. Blocking blood flow to fibroids helps to shrink them. During the procedure, the surgeon passes a catheter through the large artery in the thigh. This also is known as the femoral artery. The surgeon guides the catheter to the blood vessels in the uterus and injects tiny beads or sponges to reduce blood flow to the fibroid.Focused ultrasound.This procedure shrinks fibroids by targeting and destroying fibroids through ultrasound waves and radiofrequency energy. It needs no incisions.Myomectomy.This is the surgical removal of uterine fibroids. Depending on the size, number and location of the fibroids, your surgeon may perform the myomectomy through several small incisions in the abdomen. This is known also as the laparoscopic approach. Or the surgeon may put a thin, flexible tube into the vagina and cervix to see and remove fibroids or polyps inside the uterus. This also is called the hysteroscopic approach.Endometrial ablation.This procedure involves destroying the lining of the uterus. The process of destroying tissue also is known as ablation. The surgeon uses a laser, radio waves or heat applied to the lining of the uterus to destroy the tissue.After endometrial ablation, you may have much lighter periods. Pregnancy after endometrial ablation isn't likely but is possible and could be dangerous. Using reliable or permanent birth control until menopause is recommended.Endometrial resection.The surgeon uses an electrosurgical wire loop to remove the lining of the uterus. Pregnancy isn't recommended after this procedure.Hysterectomy.In this procedure, the uterus and cervix are removed. It ends menstrual periods and the ability to get pregnant. Hysterectomy is performed under anesthesia and may require a short hospital stay. Early menopause may occur if the ovaries are removed. The procedure to remove both ovaries is called bilateral oophorectomy.Dilation and curettage, also called a D&C.In this procedure, your doctor opens your cervix. This also is called dilating the cervix. The doctor then scrapes or suctions tissue from the lining of your uterus. This also is known as curettage.

You may need a general anesthetic but it's likely that you can go home on the same day. With an abdominal myomectomy or a hysterectomy, you may need a brief hospital stay.Sometimes heavy menstrual bleeding is a sign of another condition, such as thyroid disease. In those cases, treating the condition usually results in lighter periods.More InformationHeavy periods: Can folic acid help?Ablation therapyDilation and curettage (D&C)Endometrial ablationHormonal IUD (Mirena)Show more related informationMore InformationHeavy periods: Can folic acid help?Ablation therapyDilation and curettage (D&C)Endometrial ablationHormonal IUD (Mirena)Show more related informationHeavy periods: Can folic acid help?Ablation therapyDilation and curettage (D&C)Endometrial ablationHormonal IUD (Mirena)Heavy periods: Can folic acid help?Heavy periods: Can folic acid help?Ablation therapyAblation therapyDilation and curettage (D&C)Dilation and curettage (D&C)Endometrial ablationEndometrial ablationHormonal IUD (Mirena)Hormonal IUD (Mirena)Show more related informationRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

    "515: Pulmonary fibrosis": "The lung scarring that occurs in pulmonary fibrosis can't be reversed, and no current treatment has proved effective in stopping progression of the disease. Some treatments may improve symptoms temporarily or slow the disease's progression. Others may help improve quality of life. Doctors will evaluate the severity of your condition to determine the most appropriate treatment for your condition.MedicationsYour doctor may recommend newer medications, including pirfenidone (Esbriet) and nintedanib (Ofev). These medications may help slow the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Both medications have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additional medications and new formulations of these medications are being developed but have not yet been FDA approved.Nintedanib can cause side effects such as diarrhea and nausea.

Early term delivery, around 37 weeks, may lower the risk of stillbirth. Vaginal delivery is recommended by induction of labor unless there are other reasons a cesarean section is needed.Future birth controlA history of cholestasis of pregnancy may increase the risk of symptoms returning with contraceptives that contain estrogen, so other methods of birth control are generally recommended. These include progestin-containing contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs) or barrier methods, such as condoms or diaphragms.Request an appointmentRequest an appointment",
    "772.10: Intraventricular hemorrhage": "Treatment focuses on stabilizing your condition, treating an aneurysm if you have one, and preventing complications.Your provider checks your breathing, blood pressure, and blood flow.If your bleeding is caused by a ruptured brain aneurysm, your provider might recommend:Surgery.The surgeon makes an incision in the scalp and locates the brain aneurysm. A metal clip is placed on the aneurysm to stop the blood flow to it.Endovascular embolization.The surgeon inserts a catheter into an artery and threads it to your brain. Detachable platinum coils are guided through the catheter and placed in the aneurysm. The coils fill the aneurysm, reducing blood flow into the aneurysm sac and causing the blood to clot. Different types of coils have been developed to treat various aneurysms.Other endovascular treatments.Certain aneurysms can be treated with endovascular embolization that uses newer technology such as stent-assisted or balloon-assisted coiling or devices that divert blood flow.Surgery.The surgeon makes an incision in the scalp and locates the brain aneurysm.

One medication, nimodipine (Nymalize) has been shown to decrease circulation problems to the brain after a subarachnoid hemorrhage.A common complication after an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is delayed spasm of the blood vessels in the brain. This can cause stroke if it reduces the blood flow below a certain level. When this complication occurs, strokes may be avoided by raising the blood pressure with intravenous medications or increasing the width of the blood vessels in the brain with medications.Another common complication is hydrocephalus which is an accumulation of fluid in brain spaces. This problem can be treated with drains inserted in the head (ventriculostomy catheter) or in the lower back (lumbar drains).Sometimes, procedures need to be repeated. You'll have regular follow-up appointments with your provider to watch for any changes. You may also need physical, occupational and speech therapy.",

Your pregnancy care provider may recommend close monitoring of your baby while you're pregnant.Monitoring may include:Nonstress testing.During a nonstress test, your pregnancy care provider will check your baby's heart rate, and how much the heart rate increases with activity.Fetal biophysical profile (BPP).This series of tests helps monitor your baby's well-being. It provides information about your baby's heart rate, movement, muscle tone, breathing movements and amount of amniotic fluid.Nonstress testing.During a nonstress test, your pregnancy care provider will check your baby's heart rate, and how much the heart rate increases with activity.Nonstress testing.Fetal biophysical profile (BPP).This series of tests helps monitor your baby's well-being. It provides information about your baby's heart rate, movement, muscle tone, breathing movements and amount of amniotic fluid.Fetal biophysical profile (BPP).While the results of these tests can be reassuring, they can't predict the risk of preterm birth or other complications associated with cholestasis of pregnancy.Early deliveryEven if prenatal tests are within standard limits, your pregnancy care provider may suggest inducing labor before your due date. Early term delivery, around 37 weeks, may lower the risk of stillbirth. Vaginal delivery is recommended by induction of labor unless there are other reasons a cesarean section is needed.Future birth controlA history of cholestasis of pregnancy may increase the risk of symptoms returning with contraceptives that contain estrogen, so other methods of birth control are generally recommended. These include progestin-containing contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs) or barrier methods, such as condoms or diaphragms.Request an appointmentRequest an appointment",
    "E878.8: Surgery": "Treatment for a brain tumor depends on whether the tumor is a brain cancer or if it's not cancerous, also called a benign brain tumor. Treatment options also depend on the type, size, grade and location of the brain tumor. Options might include surgery, radiation therapy, radiosurgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. When considering your treatment options, your health care team also considers your overall health and your preferences.Treatment might not be needed right away. You might not need treatment right away if your brain tumor is small, isn't cancerous and doesn't cause symptoms. Small, benign brain tumors might not grow or might grow so slowly that they won't ever cause problems. You might have brainMRIscans a few times a year to check for brain tumor growth. If the brain tumor grows more quickly than expected or if you develop symptoms, you might need treatment.MRISurgeryEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEnlarge imageCloseEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryIn transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, a surgical instrument is placed through the nostril and alongside the nasal septum to access a pituitary tumor.Endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEnlarge imageEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEnlarge imageEnlarge imageCloseEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryIn transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, a surgical instrument is placed through the nostril and alongside the nasal septum to access a pituitary tumor.CloseEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryIn transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, a surgical instrument is placed through the nostril and alongside the nasal septum to access a pituitary tumor.CloseEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryIn transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, a surgical instrument is placed through the nostril and alongside the nasal septum to access a pituitary tumor.CloseCloseCloseEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryIn transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, a surgical instrument is placed through the nostril and alongside the nasal septum to access a pituitary tumor.Endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryIn transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, a surgical instrument is placed through the nostril and alongside the nasal septum to access a pituitary tumor.The goal of surgery for a brain tumor is to remove all of the tumor cells. The tumor can't always be removed completely. When it's possible, the surgeon works to remove as much of the brain tumor as can be done safely. Brain tumor removal surgery can be used to treat brain cancers and benign brain tumors.Some brain tumors are small and easy to separate from surrounding brain tissue. This makes it likely that the tumor will be removed completely. Other brain tumors can't be separated from surrounding tissue. Sometimes a brain tumor is near an important part of the brain. Surgery might be risky in this situation. The surgeon might take out as much of the tumor as is safe. Removing only part of a brain tumor is sometimes called a subtotal resection.Removal of part of your brain tumor may help reduce your symptoms.There are many ways of doing a brain tumor removal surgery. Which option is best for you depends on your situation. Examples of types of brain tumor surgery include:Removing part of the skull to get to the brain tumor.Brain surgery that involves removing part of the skull is called craniotomy. It's the way most brain tumor removal operations are done. Craniotomy is used for treating cancerous brain tumors and benign brain tumors.The surgeon makes a cut in your scalp. The skin and muscles are moved out of the way. Then the surgeon uses a drill to cut out a section of skull bone. The bone is removed to get access to the brain. If the tumor is deep within the brain, a tool might be used to gently hold healthy brain tissue out of the way. The brain tumor is cut out with special tools. Sometimes lasers are used to destroy the tumor.During the surgery, you receive medicine to numb the area so you won't feel anything. You're also given medicine that puts you in a sleep-like state during surgery. Sometimes you are awakened during brain surgery. This is called awake brain surgery. When you're awakened, the surgeon might ask questions and monitor the activity in your brain as you respond. This helps lower the risk of hurting important parts of the brain.When the tumor removal surgery is finished, the part of the skull bone is put back in place.Using a long, thin tube to get to the brain tumor.Endoscopic brain surgery involves putting a long, thin tube into the brain. The tube is called an endoscope. The tube has a series of lenses or a tiny camera that transmits pictures to the surgeon. Special tools are put through the tube to remove the tumor.Endoscopic brain surgery is often used to treat pituitary tumors. These tumors grow just behind the nasal cavity. The long, thin tube is put through the nose and sinuses and into the brain.Sometimes endoscopic brain surgery is used to remove brain tumors in other parts of the brain. The surgeon might use a drill to make a hole in the skull. The long, thin tube is carefully put through the brain tissue. The tube continues until it reaches the brain tumor.Removing part of the skull to get to the brain tumor.Brain surgery that involves removing part of the skull is called craniotomy.

These can include infection, bleeding, blood clots and injury to the brain tissue. Other risks may depend on the part of the brain where the tumor is located. For instance, surgery on a tumor near nerves that connect to the eyes might have a risk of vision loss. Surgery to remove a tumor on a nerve that controls hearing could cause hearing loss.Radiation therapyRadiation therapy for brain tumors uses powerful energy beams to kill tumor cells. The energy can come from X-rays, protons and other sources. Radiation therapy for brain tumors usually comes from a machine outside the body. This is called external beam radiation. Rarely, the radiation can be placed inside the body. This is called brachytherapy.Radiation therapy can be used to treat brain cancers and benign brain tumors.External beam radiation therapy is usually done in short daily treatments. A typical treatment plan might involve having radiation treatments five days a week for 2 to 6 weeks.External beam radiation can focus just on the area of your brain where the tumor is located, or it can be applied to your entire brain. Most people with a brain tumor will have radiation aimed at the area around the tumor. If there are many tumors, the entire brain might need radiation treatment. When all of the brain is treated, it's called whole-brain radiation. Whole-brain radiation is most often used to treat cancer that spreads to the brain from another part of the body and forms multiple tumors in the brain.Traditionally, radiation therapy uses X-rays, but a newer form of this treatment uses energy from protons. The proton beams can be more carefully targeted to only hurt the tumor cells. They may be less likely to hurt nearby healthy tissue. Proton therapy may be helpful for treating brain tumors in children. It also may help in treating tumors that are very close to important parts of the brain. Proton therapy isn't as widely available as traditional X-ray radiation therapy.Side effects of radiation therapy for brain tumors depend on the type and dose of radiation you receive. Common side effects that happen during treatment or right after it are fatigue, headaches, memory loss, scalp irritation and hair loss. Sometimes radiation therapy side effects show up many years later. These late side effects might include memory and thinking problems.RadiosurgeryGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryEnlarge imageCloseGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryEnlarge imageGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryEnlarge imageEnlarge imageCloseGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.CloseGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.CloseGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.CloseCloseCloseGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.Stereotactic radiosurgery for brain tumors is an intense form of radiation treatment. It aims beams of radiation from many angles at the brain tumor. Each beam isn't very powerful. But the point where the beams meet gets a very large dose of radiation that kills the tumor cells.Radiosurgery can be used to treat brain cancers and benign brain tumors.There are different types of technology used in radiosurgery to deliver radiation to treat brain tumors. Some examples include:Linear accelerator radiosurgery.Linear accelerator machines also are called LINAC machines.LINACmachines are known by their brand names, such as CyberKnife, TrueBeam and others. ALINACmachine aims carefully shaped beams of energy one at a time from several different angles. The beams are made of X-rays.Gamma Knife radiosurgery.A Gamma Knife machine aims many small beams of radiation at the same time. The beams are made of gamma rays.Proton radiosurgery.Proton radiosurgery uses beams made of protons. This is the newest type of radiosurgery. It's becoming more common but isn't available at all hospitals.Linear accelerator radiosurgery.Linear accelerator machines also are called LINAC machines.LINACmachines are known by their brand names, such as CyberKnife, TrueBeam and others.

You can go home after treatment and don't need to stay in a hospital.Side effects of radiosurgery include feeling very tired and skin changes on your scalp. The skin on your head may feel dry, itchy and sensitive. You might have blisters on the skin or hair loss. Sometimes the hair loss is permanent.ChemotherapyChemotherapy for brain tumors uses strong medicines to kill tumor cells. Chemotherapy medicines can be taken in pill form or injected into a vein. Sometimes the chemotherapy medicine is placed in the brain tissue during surgery.Chemotherapy can be used to treat brain cancers and benign brain tumors. Sometimes it's done at the same time as radiation therapy.Chemotherapy side effects depend on the type and dose of drugs you receive. Chemotherapy can cause nausea, vomiting and hair loss.Targeted therapyTargeted therapy for brain tumors uses medicines that attack specific chemicals present within the tumor cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause tumor cells to die.Targeted therapy medicines are available for certain types of brain cancers and benign brain tumors. Your brain tumor cells may be tested to see whether targeted therapy is likely to help you.Recovering after treatmentAfter treatment, you might need help to regain function in the part of your brain that had the tumor. You could need help with moving, speaking, seeing and thinking. Based on your specific needs, your health care provider might suggest:Physical therapyto help you regain lost motor skills or muscle strength.Occupational therapyto help you get back to your typical daily activities, including work.Speech therapyto help if speaking is difficult.Tutoring for school-age childrento help them cope with changes in their memory and thinking.Physical therapyto help you regain lost motor skills or muscle strength.Physical therapyOccupational therapyto help you get back to your typical daily activities, including work.Occupational therapySpeech therapyto help if speaking is difficult.Speech therapyTutoring for school-age childrento help them cope with changes in their memory and thinking.Tutoring for school-age childrenMore InformationBrain tumor care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAcupunctureBrain stereotactic radiosurgeryChemotherapyHypnosisMeditationRadiation therapyStereotactic radiosurgeryBrain tumor FAQsInfographic: Proton Beam Brain TumorShow more related informationMore InformationBrain tumor care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAcupunctureBrain stereotactic radiosurgeryChemotherapyHypnosisMeditationRadiation therapyStereotactic radiosurgeryBrain tumor FAQsInfographic: Proton Beam Brain TumorShow more related informationBrain tumor care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAcupunctureBrain stereotactic radiosurgeryChemotherapyHypnosisMeditationRadiation therapyStereotactic radiosurgeryBrain tumor FAQsInfographic: Proton Beam Brain TumorBrain tumor care at Mayo ClinicBrain tumor care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAblation therapyAcupunctureAcupunctureBrain stereotactic radiosurgeryBrain stereotactic radiosurgeryChemotherapyChemotherapyHypnosisHypnosisMeditationMeditationRadiation therapyRadiation therapyStereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgeryBrain tumor FAQsBrain tumor FAQsInfographic: Proton Beam Brain TumorInfographic: Proton Beam Brain TumorShow more related informationRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

    "E879.8: Surgery": "Treatment for a brain tumor depends on whether the tumor is a brain cancer or if it's not cancerous, also called a benign brain tumor. Treatment options also depend on the type, size, grade and location of the brain tumor. Options might include surgery, radiation therapy, radiosurgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. When considering your treatment options, your health care team also considers your overall health and your preferences.Treatment might not be needed right away. You might not need treatment right away if your brain tumor is small, isn't cancerous and doesn't cause symptoms. Small, benign brain tumors might not grow or might grow so slowly that they won't ever cause problems. You might have brainMRIscans a few times a year to check for brain tumor growth. If the brain tumor grows more quickly than expected or if you develop symptoms, you might need treatment.MRISurgeryEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEnlarge imageCloseEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryIn transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, a surgical instrument is placed through the nostril and alongside the nasal septum to access a pituitary tumor.Endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEnlarge imageEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEnlarge imageEnlarge imageCloseEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryIn transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, a surgical instrument is placed through the nostril and alongside the nasal septum to access a pituitary tumor.CloseEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryIn transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, a surgical instrument is placed through the nostril and alongside the nasal septum to access a pituitary tumor.CloseEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryIn transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, a surgical instrument is placed through the nostril and alongside the nasal septum to access a pituitary tumor.CloseCloseCloseEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryEndoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryIn transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, a surgical instrument is placed through the nostril and alongside the nasal septum to access a pituitary tumor.Endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgeryIn transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, a surgical instrument is placed through the nostril and alongside the nasal septum to access a pituitary tumor.The goal of surgery for a brain tumor is to remove all of the tumor cells. The tumor can't always be removed completely. When it's possible, the surgeon works to remove as much of the brain tumor as can be done safely. Brain tumor removal surgery can be used to treat brain cancers and benign brain tumors.Some brain tumors are small and easy to separate from surrounding brain tissue. This makes it likely that the tumor will be removed completely. Other brain tumors can't be separated from surrounding tissue. Sometimes a brain tumor is near an important part of the brain. Surgery might be risky in this situation. The surgeon might take out as much of the tumor as is safe. Removing only part of a brain tumor is sometimes called a subtotal resection.Removal of part of your brain tumor may help reduce your symptoms.There are many ways of doing a brain tumor removal surgery. Which option is best for you depends on your situation. Examples of types of brain tumor surgery include:Removing part of the skull to get to the brain tumor.Brain surgery that involves removing part of the skull is called craniotomy. It's the way most brain tumor removal operations are done. Craniotomy is used for treating cancerous brain tumors and benign brain tumors.The surgeon makes a cut in your scalp. The skin and muscles are moved out of the way. Then the surgeon uses a drill to cut out a section of skull bone. The bone is removed to get access to the brain. If the tumor is deep within the brain, a tool might be used to gently hold healthy brain tissue out of the way. The brain tumor is cut out with special tools. Sometimes lasers are used to destroy the tumor.During the surgery, you receive medicine to numb the area so you won't feel anything. You're also given medicine that puts you in a sleep-like state during surgery. Sometimes you are awakened during brain surgery. This is called awake brain surgery. When you're awakened, the surgeon might ask questions and monitor the activity in your brain as you respond. This helps lower the risk of hurting important parts of the brain.When the tumor removal surgery is finished, the part of the skull bone is put back in place.Using a long, thin tube to get to the brain tumor.Endoscopic brain surgery involves putting a long, thin tube into the brain. The tube is called an endoscope. The tube has a series of lenses or a tiny camera that transmits pictures to the surgeon. Special tools are put through the tube to remove the tumor.Endoscopic brain surgery is often used to treat pituitary tumors. These tumors grow just behind the nasal cavity. The long, thin tube is put through the nose and sinuses and into the brain.Sometimes endoscopic brain surgery is used to remove brain tumors in other parts of the brain. The surgeon might use a drill to make a hole in the skull. The long, thin tube is carefully put through the brain tissue. The tube continues until it reaches the brain tumor.Removing part of the skull to get to the brain tumor.Brain surgery that involves removing part of the skull is called craniotomy.

These can include infection, bleeding, blood clots and injury to the brain tissue. Other risks may depend on the part of the brain where the tumor is located. For instance, surgery on a tumor near nerves that connect to the eyes might have a risk of vision loss. Surgery to remove a tumor on a nerve that controls hearing could cause hearing loss.Radiation therapyRadiation therapy for brain tumors uses powerful energy beams to kill tumor cells. The energy can come from X-rays, protons and other sources. Radiation therapy for brain tumors usually comes from a machine outside the body. This is called external beam radiation. Rarely, the radiation can be placed inside the body. This is called brachytherapy.Radiation therapy can be used to treat brain cancers and benign brain tumors.External beam radiation therapy is usually done in short daily treatments. A typical treatment plan might involve having radiation treatments five days a week for 2 to 6 weeks.External beam radiation can focus just on the area of your brain where the tumor is located, or it can be applied to your entire brain. Most people with a brain tumor will have radiation aimed at the area around the tumor. If there are many tumors, the entire brain might need radiation treatment. When all of the brain is treated, it's called whole-brain radiation. Whole-brain radiation is most often used to treat cancer that spreads to the brain from another part of the body and forms multiple tumors in the brain.Traditionally, radiation therapy uses X-rays, but a newer form of this treatment uses energy from protons. The proton beams can be more carefully targeted to only hurt the tumor cells. They may be less likely to hurt nearby healthy tissue. Proton therapy may be helpful for treating brain tumors in children. It also may help in treating tumors that are very close to important parts of the brain. Proton therapy isn't as widely available as traditional X-ray radiation therapy.Side effects of radiation therapy for brain tumors depend on the type and dose of radiation you receive. Common side effects that happen during treatment or right after it are fatigue, headaches, memory loss, scalp irritation and hair loss. Sometimes radiation therapy side effects show up many years later. These late side effects might include memory and thinking problems.RadiosurgeryGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryEnlarge imageCloseGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryEnlarge imageGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryEnlarge imageEnlarge imageCloseGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.CloseGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.CloseGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.CloseCloseCloseGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryGamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgery technology uses many small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.Stereotactic radiosurgery for brain tumors is an intense form of radiation treatment. It aims beams of radiation from many angles at the brain tumor. Each beam isn't very powerful. But the point where the beams meet gets a very large dose of radiation that kills the tumor cells.Radiosurgery can be used to treat brain cancers and benign brain tumors.There are different types of technology used in radiosurgery to deliver radiation to treat brain tumors. Some examples include:Linear accelerator radiosurgery.Linear accelerator machines also are called LINAC machines.LINACmachines are known by their brand names, such as CyberKnife, TrueBeam and others. ALINACmachine aims carefully shaped beams of energy one at a time from several different angles. The beams are made of X-rays.Gamma Knife radiosurgery.A Gamma Knife machine aims many small beams of radiation at the same time. The beams are made of gamma rays.Proton radiosurgery.Proton radiosurgery uses beams made of protons. This is the newest type of radiosurgery. It's becoming more common but isn't available at all hospitals.Linear accelerator radiosurgery.Linear accelerator machines also are called LINAC machines.LINACmachines are known by their brand names, such as CyberKnife, TrueBeam and others.

You can go home after treatment and don't need to stay in a hospital.Side effects of radiosurgery include feeling very tired and skin changes on your scalp. The skin on your head may feel dry, itchy and sensitive. You might have blisters on the skin or hair loss. Sometimes the hair loss is permanent.ChemotherapyChemotherapy for brain tumors uses strong medicines to kill tumor cells. Chemotherapy medicines can be taken in pill form or injected into a vein. Sometimes the chemotherapy medicine is placed in the brain tissue during surgery.Chemotherapy can be used to treat brain cancers and benign brain tumors. Sometimes it's done at the same time as radiation therapy.Chemotherapy side effects depend on the type and dose of drugs you receive. Chemotherapy can cause nausea, vomiting and hair loss.Targeted therapyTargeted therapy for brain tumors uses medicines that attack specific chemicals present within the tumor cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause tumor cells to die.Targeted therapy medicines are available for certain types of brain cancers and benign brain tumors. Your brain tumor cells may be tested to see whether targeted therapy is likely to help you.Recovering after treatmentAfter treatment, you might need help to regain function in the part of your brain that had the tumor. You could need help with moving, speaking, seeing and thinking. Based on your specific needs, your health care provider might suggest:Physical therapyto help you regain lost motor skills or muscle strength.Occupational therapyto help you get back to your typical daily activities, including work.Speech therapyto help if speaking is difficult.Tutoring for school-age childrento help them cope with changes in their memory and thinking.Physical therapyto help you regain lost motor skills or muscle strength.Physical therapyOccupational therapyto help you get back to your typical daily activities, including work.Occupational therapySpeech therapyto help if speaking is difficult.Speech therapyTutoring for school-age childrento help them cope with changes in their memory and thinking.Tutoring for school-age childrenMore InformationBrain tumor care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAcupunctureBrain stereotactic radiosurgeryChemotherapyHypnosisMeditationRadiation therapyStereotactic radiosurgeryBrain tumor FAQsInfographic: Proton Beam Brain TumorShow more related informationMore InformationBrain tumor care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAcupunctureBrain stereotactic radiosurgeryChemotherapyHypnosisMeditationRadiation therapyStereotactic radiosurgeryBrain tumor FAQsInfographic: Proton Beam Brain TumorShow more related informationBrain tumor care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAcupunctureBrain stereotactic radiosurgeryChemotherapyHypnosisMeditationRadiation therapyStereotactic radiosurgeryBrain tumor FAQsInfographic: Proton Beam Brain TumorBrain tumor care at Mayo ClinicBrain tumor care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAblation therapyAcupunctureAcupunctureBrain stereotactic radiosurgeryBrain stereotactic radiosurgeryChemotherapyChemotherapyHypnosisHypnosisMeditationMeditationRadiation therapyRadiation therapyStereotactic radiosurgeryStereotactic radiosurgeryBrain tumor FAQsBrain tumor FAQsInfographic: Proton Beam Brain TumorInfographic: Proton Beam Brain TumorShow more related informationRequest an appointmentRequest an appointmentThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

    "427.5: Cardiac arrest": "Treatment for sudden cardiac death includes:CPR.ImmediateCPRis needed to treat sudden cardiac arrest and prevent death.Resetting the heart rhythm.This is called defibrillation. You can do this by using an automated external defibrillator, called anAED, if one is available. They are found in many public places.Medicinesto treat irregular heartbeats and to manage symptoms.Heart procedure or surgeryto place heart devices or to treat a blockage.CPR.ImmediateCPRis needed to treat sudden cardiac arrest and prevent death.CPR.CPRCPRResetting the heart rhythm.This is called defibrillation.

They are found in many public places.Resetting the heart rhythm.AEDMedicinesto treat irregular heartbeats and to manage symptoms.MedicinesHeart procedure or surgeryto place heart devices or to treat a blockage.Heart procedure or surgeryAt the emergency room, health care providers run tests to check for the cause, such as a possible heart attack, heart failure or changes in electrolyte levels. Treatments depend on the causes.MedicationsMedicines may be used to help restore the heart rhythm. These medicines are called anti-arrhythmic drugs.Other medicines that might be used to treat causes of sudden cardiac death or lower the risk of it include:Beta blockers.Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.Calcium channel blockers.Beta blockers.Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.Calcium channel blockers.Surgery or other proceduresSurgeries and other treatments may be needed to correct a heart rhythm problem, open a blockage, or place a device to help the heart work better. They may include:Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).AnICDis a battery-powered unit that's implanted under the skin near the collarbone \u2014 similar to a pacemaker. TheICDcontinuously monitors the heart rhythm. If the device finds an irregular heartbeat, it sends out shocks to reset the heart's rhythm. It can stop a potentially life-threatening change in the heartbeat.Coronary angioplasty.Also called percutaneous coronary intervention, this treatment opens blocked or clogged heart arteries. It can be done at the same time as a coronary catheterization, a test that doctors do to find narrowed arteries to the heart.The health care provider inserts a thin, flexible tube into a blood vessel, usually in the groin, and moves it to the area of the blockage. A tiny balloon on the tip of the tube is widened. This opens the artery and improves blood flow to the heart.A metal mesh tube called a stent may be passed through the tube. The stent stays in the artery and helps keep it open.Coronary artery bypass surgery.Also called coronary artery bypass grafting or CABG, this surgery creates a new pathway for blood to flow around a blocked artery to the heart. This restores blood flow to the heart.Radiofrequency catheter ablation.This treatment is done to block a faulty heart signaling pathway. A problem with heart signaling can cause an irregular heartbeat. One or more flexible tubes called catheters are threaded through the blood vessels to inside the heart. Heat, called radiofrequency energy, on the end of the catheter is used to create small scars in the heart. This blocks the irregular heart signals.Corrective heart surgery.Surgery may be done to correct heart problems present at birth, heart valve disease or diseased heart muscle.Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).AnICDis a battery-powered unit that's implanted under the skin near the collarbone \u2014 similar to a pacemaker.
